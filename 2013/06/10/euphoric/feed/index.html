					<description><![CDATA[On an unrelated note, when you say you flew in &quot;my airplane&quot; do you mean that you own an airplane? I am experiencing great amounts of envy right now. I didn&#039;t know that about you. What kind of airplane? I want to buy a Sonex one day. We&#039;re saving up so I can get it when I&#039;m 40. I have hardly used my pilot&#039;s license since I got it about 20 years ago which is a perpetual source of disappointment for me.

Jealous, I am jealous!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“things are happening”
“a shift is occurring”
“significant events”
“the months leading up to September will be significant”
This is all so terribly vague. Are you able to provide any details of any kind in order that we may test the reliability of these prophecies that have “been foretold for a long time now?” What, exactly, has been foretold?]]></description>
