					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanmonk.com/2013/01/27/anita-moorjani/#comment-954&quot;&gt;Simran&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry I have taken so long to reply to your comment. Thank you for reading my review of Moorjani&#039;s book. Am glad you enjoyed that. 

Regarding your comments, I have not written any books myself. Only what is on this website: urbanmonk.com. I am not a vegetarian, I do meditate and pray. I don&#039;t follow any one spiritual path. My aim is to seek God, the Source, Heaven, Spirit. I use whatever comes my way to achieve this aim.

I was brought up in a very conservative, Evangelical environment, which, of course, has influenced me heavily. It has been a long slow journey to arrive where I am now, since I had many pre-conceived notions to overcome. I still participate in Church; I still consider myself a Christian, but recognize that I have moved quite a ways away from the belief system I grew up in.

If you read my reflections under the title &quot;Out of Winkler&quot;, in the later chapters I go into some depth regarding my own experience of the spiritual realm. I have undergone several soul regression sessions, which have been utterly profound and life-changing. Let me know if you have any more questions.]]></description>
