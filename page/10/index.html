				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>It was with tremendous fascination that I read Dr Raymond Moody&#8217;s first book, <em>Life After Life</em>, stories of near-death-experiences (NDE&#8217;s). Published in the mid-seventies, this book was absolutely ground-breaking, in society, but also in my own life. It started me down the path to exploring the truths about the afterlife. These initial (for me) truths were provided by those who had experienced death and come back to tell about it. Dr Moody had documented hundreds, if not thousands, of peoples&#8217; NDE&#8217;s. The utter consistency of these experiences was compelling. I had no doubt whatsoever about the veracity of their reports. Thus began a life-long interest in NDE&#8217;s. Although I would not describe myself as obsessed with these accounts, I did avidly read them whenever I encountered them.</p>
<p>So when I heard about a subsequent book written by Raymond Moody, I had to check it out! His new book, <em>Glimpses of Eternity: Sharing a Loved One&#8217;s Passage from this Life to the Next</em>, 2010, narrows its vision to one aspect of NDE&#8217;s, people who experience part of someone else&#8217;s NDE. Almost always this is a loved one accompanying the person who is dying. As the person&#8217;s body expires, sometimes there are mystical elements associated with this transition.</p>
<p>Again, as with his first book, Dr Moody is collecting stories of what he has come to call &#8220;shared death experiences&#8221;. And he documents the common elements of these experiences. No one person has experienced all seven of the common elements,           but &#8220;. . . a person having a shared death experience will most likely have a few of them&#8211;or perhaps even only one.&#8221; (p 76).</p>
<p>These seven elements are: change of geometry, mystical light, music and music sounds, out-of-body experience, co-living a life review, encountering unworldly or &#8220;heavenly&#8221; realms, mist at death. Moody expands on each of these, sharing many stories of people who experienced these various things.</p>
<p>In addition to telling many stories of shared death experiences, Moody also discusses this phenomenon in historical literature. He supposes these experiences (including NDE&#8217;s) have occurred all through history, but only recently has there been an effort to document them in any sort of systematic way.</p>
<p>One fascinating conclusion Dr Moody has come to through this study of shared death experiences is that they offer much more concrete proof of an afterlife than do NDE&#8217;s. There were many who, upon being exposed to the phenomena of NDE&#8217;s, were quick to explain them away as &#8220;. . . hallucinations, a phenomenon tossed up by biochemical and electrical failures in the dying brain.&#8221; (p 72). He discusses this as a safety net for those unable to accept something so radically different from their accepted belief system.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, shared death experiences do not offer any such safety net. . . . these people were not dying or even sick, an obvious fact that throws a major monkey wrench into the standard way of debating this highly important issue.&#8221; (p 72,73). In addition, NDE&#8217;s could be explained away as being one person&#8217;s experience, and thus subjective. Shared death experiences, on the other hand, were shared experiences, and not so easily shuffled aside.</p>
<p>Moody admits to being mystified by these experiences he has collected and documented. &#8220;There is no settled language to explain these experiences. But nonetheless they exist. It is as if the other side somehow opens up and invites us to take a closer look.&#8221; (p 73). Being mystified is not a negative, in Moody&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I think it is good for mankind to have a hearty dose of the unexplained.&#8221; (p 165). These experiences are life-changing for those who undergo them. And while there is an inbuilt mechanism demanding explanations, it is good for us to have mystery in our lives. &#8220;We are a long way from explaining shared death experiences, a lack of explanation that I find a good thing. What the world needs now is an unexplainable mystery, one that offers great hope.&#8221; (p 166).</p>
<p>This mystery encourages us to surrender ourselves to the ineffable. Moody quotes Joseph Campbell, &#8220;We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.&#8221; (p 164). And Carl Jung, &#8220;The seat of faith . . . is not consciousness but spontaneous religious experience, which brings the individual&#8217;s faith into immediate relation with God.&#8221; (p 165).</p>
<p>This is a fascinating little book, worth a read by anyone even remotely interested in the afterlife, the spiritual dimension to which we all are heading sooner or later!</p>

			<p>This is the third in a series of books written by Kimberly Klein. The first, <em><a title="Hummingbirds" href="../../index.html%3Fp=356.html">Hummingbirds Don&#8217;t Fly in the Rain</a></em>, was reviewed by me some months ago. I would recommend anyone interested in these books to read <em>Hummingbirds. . . .</em> first. It tells the story which sets up the following two books, <em>The Universe Speaks</em>,<a title="Two Book Reviews!" href="../../index.html%3Fp=28.html"> books one</a> and two.</p>
<p><em>The Universe Speaks</em> are transcriptions of the messages received from Talia, a 13 year-old girl who died in an airplane crash December, 2007. After she died she began contacting her mother, the author, and others, most notably <em>&#8220;G&#8221;</em>, a family friend who began hearing from Talia in very clear communications.</p>
<p>The messages from heaven contained in these two volumes are profound, reassuring, healing, and utterly fascinating. They are reassuring to anyone doubting the reality of the afterlife. Talia removes all doubt about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> little detail!!</p>
<p>They are healing in the sense that Talia shares some of what her life over there is like. She is very busy, all the time. She is hard at work preparing people on earth for an understanding of their eternal nature. She works at helping earthlings understand how they can help others toward new consciousness. It sparks my confidence to think that heaven and its occupants are working very diligently to help us here on earth grow spiritually, assisting the transition of earth to a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>From my own understanding of the Spirit realms, Talia must have been a very advanced soul prior to coming to earth as Kimberly&#8217;s daughter. She was able to contact her earthbound family and friends very shortly after her death. And she was able to do this over a long period of time, very consistently, as recorded in these books.</p>
<p>The things learned from Talia&#8217;s communications are profound. There is so much about God and the heavenly realms which we do not understand. To hear Talia speak matter-of-factly about these realms makes it seem real and concrete.</p>
<p>Although Talia did not grow up in a religious home, her language is permeated with religious concepts and language. There is nothing in the things she says which disagrees with the Christian writings, the Bible. If anything they are affirming of the biblical writings, expanding on them to be sure, and making them seem very concrete.</p>
<p>I read a fair amount of spiritualistic writings. I have also had personal out-of-body experiences of the Spirit dimension. It is continually amazing to me (though it shouldn&#8217;t be, I guess!) how consistent all these messages are. Hearing the same things over and over, from diverse and numerous sources, makes these truths that much more real, lends them validity and credence.</p>
<p>One caution to potential readers: these books are quite spiritually profound and deep. Not everyone will be able to understand or accept the things presented in them. If you find that to be the case, then just chalk it up to something like perhaps you are not ready for these books. Or perhaps not ready to hear the truths being presented in them. Do not be judgemental toward those who are, and especially to those who go to the work of sharing these truths with the rest of us.</p>
<p>I am so thankful to Kimberly Klein for giving the world access to the personally painful experience of losing her daughter in the flesh, and then regaining access to her in the spirit. There is so much to learn from these communications.</p>

			<p>Two dreams in the past couple weeks have impacted me. Neither of them contributed much detail, but the impact came from the feelings conveyed.</p>
<p>The first involved a view of the heavenly realms. In this spirit dimension there was a whole lot of activity occurring. There were huge numbers of beings of various description, all going about tasks. Although the activity level was way up there, there seemed to be no sense of frantic attempts to meet deadlines or anything of that sort. It was just that everyone was very busy, going back and forth in the carrying out of their duties. There was a sense of calm, peaceful busy-ness.</p>
<p>The scene tended a bit toward being somewhat vague. Colours were subdued. It was not totally black-and-white, but leaned in that direction. And right in the midst of all this activity, I became aware of one individual who stood out from the crowd in brilliant colour. And it was my father from this life! He was involved in all the activity; he was very busy, like everyone else in the scene. But for whatever reason, I was meant to notice that he in particular was there, working.</p>
<p>And it became very apparent that the work being carried out by all these heavenly beings (think of the &#8220;. . . so great a cloud of witnesses . . .&#8221; which surround us {Heb 12.1}) was all happening for our benefit. Heaven is busy at work assisting us who are presently incarnate on earth in bringing about this great shift in consciousness. And my father is involved in that work! There is a lot going on, a lot of effort being expended, for our benefit!</p>
<p>I was greatly encouraged by this!</p>
<p>The second dream had certain similarities. I was working with a group of fellows on a project of some sort. I am not sure what we were doing, exactly, but we were moving lumber around, obviously building something. The people I was working with were of indeterminate identity. But I felt in place; I belonged there. I was known and recognized as one of the numerous workers.</p>
<p>Then, walking diagonally toward us was an old man. It was as if we were situated next to a school yard, athletic fields of some sort, large, open, level playing grounds. As this old man neared us, it became clear that this was J. B. Toews.</p>
<p>J. B. Toews was the most influential leader in my church conference throughout my life. From the 1940&#8217;s onward, he carried huge power in our church. Behind his back he was often referred to as &#8220;the pope&#8221;. When he would walk into a church conference office everyone would immediately drop whatever they were doing to attend to his needs. He could be a quite intimidating presence.</p>
<p>I had encountered him a few times over the years. But my most involved contact was when I attended our denominational seminary in the early eighties. He was a professor emeritus, teaching at most, one class per semester, or perhaps only one per year. My encounters with him were completely positive. By his own admission he had mellowed over the years, crediting his sons for that. I found him to be a very wise leader of our church, full of incredible history and stories, and emanating a great love for our church.</p>
<p>Now here he was, walking by this group of working men, who all recognized who he was. Then he paused briefly in his walk, looking toward us, and said, &#8220;Dennis Voth!&#8221; It was tremendously affirming of who I was. And my fellow workers certainly looked at me in new light! To be recognized by someone of the stature of J. B. Toews was really something!</p>
<p>So, two dreams. Both tremendously encouraging and affirming of who I am. Both reassuring that the spirit dimension is actively involved in what we on earth are about, ensuring that what comes will result in positive changes in society. The message from both is to know that we are not alone in our struggle to bring about change on earth. We are involved in activities viewed as very important from heaven&#8217;s perspective. And we are completely supported in our efforts. What we do is definitely not in vain. Everything we do is important, no matter what it may look like from an earthly point-of-view.</p>

			<p>Man, I just finished a most interesting book! This is a bit outside the usual subject matter on Urban Monk, but I have to post something anyway!</p>
<p>Roger Wiens is a cousin, related both to my wife and to myself. He is a scientist working for NASA in Los Alamos, New Mexico. This book details his involvement with developing one of the instruments on the Curiosity rover currently exploring our neighbouring planet Mars.</p>
<p>Attending family reunions over the years I always viewed the two Wiens boys from Minnesota as really, really bright kids. They both ended up with PhD&#8217;s, experts in their own fields. I particularly remember one reunion in the nineties where either Doug or Roger gave a talk on ways in which science and the Bible agree, and that we don&#8217;t have to divide ourselves into camps on one side or the other. In the setting of fundamentalist mindsets of many of those present I always viewed this as a tremendously courageous talk! I was proud to be related to these brilliant people. But I had no idea of the extent of their work.</p>
<p>Until the last few years. A couple years ago we were alerted to a television appearance by Doug, an earthquake expert, following the devastating Japan earthquake. And now this book, detailing Roger&#8217;s work in space exploration.</p>
<p>The book reads like an adventure novel! It is very well written, surprisingly so for someone as highly educated as Roger Wiens! (Sorry, Roger!!) It is an articulate telling of the compelling story of one particular aspect of the Mars rover story. Roger was in charge of an instrument called ChemCam which uses lasers to analyze the composition of rocks and soil on the Mars surface. All of the gritty details of their problems, failures, disappointments, getting cancelled at one point, and successes, are told in a very entertaining way. It is a real page turner, for sure!</p>
<p>Even if the reader is not in the least interested in space exploration, it is a very good read. And for me, who has always been interested in space, flight, the cosmos, etc, I could hardly put the book down!</p>
<p>Check it out! <em>Red Rover</em>, by Roger Wiens. You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be disappointed.</p>

			<p>For a week I had been thinking that it was past time to post another blog. But no ideas would come to me; nothing seemed compelling enough to share. Then, a few days ago I watched the video of <em>Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away</em>. During this magnificent performance numerous Beatles&#8217; songs were used, including <em>Blackbird:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</p>
<p>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</p>
<p>All your life</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</p>
<p>Take these sunken eyes and learn to see</p>
<p>All your life</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to be free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blackbird fly, blackbird fly</p>
<p>Into the light of the dark black night.</p></blockquote>
<p>There it was! An idea! As I shared in <a title="Euphoric!" href="../../index.html%3Fp=427.html">June</a>, there is a growing sense of impending events signalling a significant shift in human consciousness, if not in larger society. I am reading and hearing this from many sources, and it resonates with my spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were only waiting for this moment to arise!&#8221; It is as if I, and the human race, have been waiting for oh-so-long for this moment to arise, for this moment to be free!  &#8220;Fly, into the light. . .&#8221; How we collectively have been waiting for this!</p>
<p>No clear, unified picture emerges of exactly what we are awaiting. There are, however, many ideas of what this might entail. One broad category which comes up in spiritual revelations is that of &#8220;disclosure&#8221;. But, disclosure of what, exactly?</p>
<p>Church theology from my past tells me, &#8220;We are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. . .&#8221; (Hebrews 12.1) &#8220;Lo, I am with you always . . .&#8221; (Matthew 28.20) There does appear to be evidence (and it is growing!) that we are being helped and guided by heavenly beings. In the context of some sort of coming &#8220;disclosure&#8221;, at some point, these heavenly beings will make themselves known to us; they will allow us to know their presence, to discern more clearly that they have been with us all the way and at all times, that they have been assisting us, as humanity, to grow and to increase our spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>But one message about this disclosure, repeated in various ways, is that these beings will not disclose themselves until we as a race have made some significant shifts in the way we run our affairs. One major &#8220;problem&#8221; at present is the financial imbalance in society today. The message being received is that heaven will not reveal itself prior to some significant changes in financial structures because it would cause too much panic in society to disclose earlier. Apparently once some major shifts have occurred there will be a greater openness to these beings revealing themselves. At least that is the message I am sensing most clearly. We will see if this pans out.</p>
<p>To me, completely uninvolved in the world&#8217;s financial structures, this appears to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>huge</strong></span> obstacle. Power structures are so firmly entrenched that it feels like they will never change, especially change toward the positive, toward a more equitable distribution of resources. And yet, the messages being received from heaven suggest that this sort of change will occur fairly soon (in weeks or months, not years), and that it will be a huge shift.</p>
<p>One encouraging indication I personally have been aware of is that I have read of various people and groups working to undo some of the power structures for the past number of years and decades. Some intense spiritual warfare is going on.</p>
<p>Again, since I come out of a very biblical background, I make reference to scripture. The  &#8220;. . . wiles of the devil&#8221; are listed as being not &#8220;. . . flesh and blood. . . [but] . . . principalities, . . . powers, . . . world rulers of this present darkness, . . . spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&#8221; (Ephesians 6.11,12) These forces of power have been in place for a long, long time&#8211;centuries, millennia even. And people are being called upon and equipped to participate in unravelling the intricate webs of power which have held the human race captive for so long.</p>
<p>Another encouraging sign I see in this context is NESARA, the National Economic Security and Recovery Act. Apparently this was a USA idea brought before Congress in the 1990&#8217;s. The ideas, I gather, are still around, and it sounds like there may be a move to resurrect the ideas of NESARA and hopefully implement them to some extent. NESARA concepts would lead to the aforementioned more-equitable society, less of a rich/poor divide, etc.</p>
<p>So, ideas are floating around, being talked about, and strategized. Hopefully something comes of all this.</p>
<p>Another truth I keep mulling over is the statement by Jesus, &#8220;The kingdom of God is within you.&#8221; (Luke 17.21) We have, within us already, the strength and wisdom to know what needs to be done. We are not to go looking outside ourselves for the answers or instruction we need. We have been equipped already. Just do it! We must look inside ourselves to hear God and what he wants us as individuals and societies to do in order to bring about his kingdom upon earth.</p>
<p>We might feel we are limping along with broken wings and sunken eyes, but we are asked to take our frail resources, and learn to fly, into the light of the dark black night.</p>

			<p>I feel great! This weekend was wonderful for me! Saturday began with a little flight in my airplane over the Rockies to Invermere, B.C. This was something I had been wanting to do for a long time. Flying in and over the mountains is a very different feeling than flying out over the prairies. Over the prairies there seem to be endless landing possibilities in the event of a crisis. In the mountains, watch out! Anyway, made it without incident, had a cup of coffee at the local Super 8, flew back. Returning I encountered considerably more clouds than outbound, so had to fly quite high, up to 14,000 feet, to avoid them. But it was a great feeling of accomplishment!</p>
<p>So, a positive start to the weekend. Then home, lunch, nap, and mowed the front lawn. At my house this is quite an undertaking, it being almost as much vertical as horizontal!! Cleaned out some grass and weeds around some trees, and then tackled my fence. We are contemplating building a deck in a few weeks, and my decrepit old fence has to go for that. It had to go anyway, as it was in danger every big wind we had! Got a little over half of it down.</p>
<p>So Saturday was a day full of physical work. It felt great! Also, I am on a restrictive diet and have been operating at very low energy for quite a few weeks. That I was able to accomplish as much as I did with such low energy felt like a huge deal!</p>
<p>Sunday morning, traditionally a Church day for me, I spent on the internet, catching up on numerous spirituality websites I more-or-less keep track of. And it was wonderful! The overall impression I am receiving right now is quite optimistic. It seems to be the consensus that May and before was a difficult time for many spiritual people. But June is seen as bringing in more light and positive stuff. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, spiritually. Things may look dark on the physical plane, but in the spiritual realms things are happening. There is definitely the sense that a shift is occurring.</p>
<p>This shift has been foretold for a long time now. At first many anticipated it would happen at the change of ages predicted in the Mayan calendar. This prediction was usually thought by scholars to be the winter solstice of 2012. Nothing really happened then. At least nothing visible, nothing &#8220;big&#8221;, or noticeable. There was some understandable disappointment over that. But the sun keeps coming up in the morning, so we have to go on.</p>
<p>This would accord with my opinion that setting the Mayan calendar date so precisely was a big mistake. It was based on scholars interpreting some very mysterious and enigmatic carvings on ancient ruins of the Mayan culture. I felt it was a mistake to pin it down to our own modern Julian calendar so closely.</p>
<p>Now the thinking is that the next few months promise significant events to occur. Will this have the same outcome? Will there be noticeable shifts, or disappointing sameness? I don&#8217;t know. Huge grains of salt are needed to take any of this seriously, until events actually begin occurring. However, for me personally, my past weekend certainly makes me feel that my own spirit is in accord with what I am reading from various outside sources. I resonate with the opinion that the months leading up to September will be significant. Hang on! The ride may be interesting!!! Like flying through the mountains in a small airplane!!!</p>

			<p>That is the question, isn&#8217;t it? What is the core of Christianity? Where is the heart of religion? Did Jesus come to establish a religion?</p>
<p>I find looking back on my religious/spiritual life that I have been very gradually moving from belief to experience. &#8220;Very gradually,&#8221; although sometimes in huge leaps, other times enduring long dry plateaus. &#8220;Gradually&#8221; is the overall view provided by the long look back over time!</p>
<p>On a recently-watched video of a BBC interview* with Carl Jung he was asked about his belief in God. He stated he had some trouble with that word, &#8220;believe&#8221;. &#8220;I know, I don&#8217;t need to believe. I know,&#8221; he replied. If someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knows</span> God, if someone has experienced the Divine, has experienced the Spirit realm, there is no need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believe</span> in it, or him. There is direct knowledge. This statement from one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century helped clear things up for me. It went a long way to explaining my own path, my current position.</p>
<p>Early Church experiences in the 1970&#8217;s (see <a title="CHAPTER TWO – CHARISMATICA" href="../../index.html%3Fp=139.html">Chapter 2, <em>Out of Winkler</em></a>, for example) had started me on the journey of experiencing God, as opposed to only a rational belief in him. Gradually I began realizing how limiting dogma is. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I think, at the beginning of one&#8217;s walk, that doctrine, scripture, etc, are a help along the way. I certainly value highly my own biblical training. It still informs me. I have not rejected previous training and experiences; rather, I have built on them, and continue to build on them. However, increasingly I realize, as Jung says, &#8220;Religion is a defense against religious experience.&#8221; (<em>Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul</em>, Claire Dunne, p 152). In a letter to a friend, Jung says, &#8220;People speak of belief when they have lost knowledge. Belief and disbelief in God are mere surrogates.&#8221; (<em>Wounded Healer</em>, p 153).</p>
<p>More and more I am encountering this idea: that experience and direct knowledge supersedes belief. For example, in my recently-reviewed book by <a title="Anita Moorjani" href="../../index.html%3Fp=313.html">Anita Moorjani</a>, I find the following quotes: &#8220;Instead, letting go of attachment to any way of believing or thinking has made me feel more expanded and almost transparent so that universal energy can just flow through me.&#8221; (p 160.) &#8220;So these days, I don&#8217;t follow any established methodology, order, ritual, dogma, or doctrine. . . . For me, life is a spiritual experience, and I&#8217;m changing and evolving all the time.&#8221; (p 154). &#8220;To advocate any option or doctrine as being the one true way would only serve to limit who we are and what we&#8217;ve come here to be.&#8221; (p 155).</p>
<p>Again, from another <a title="Eben Alexander" href="../../index.html%3Fp=362.html">recent review</a>: &#8220;At last, I understood what religion was really all about. Or at least was supposed to be about. I didn’t just believe in God; I knew God.&#8221; (<em>Proof of Heaven</em>, Eben Alexander, p 147).</p>
<p>It is almost precisely two years ago that I had my own profound experience of the Divine. I had my first soul regression session, and was gently ushered into the Spirit realm. (See especially, <a title="CHAPTER FIFTEEN – BETWEEN LIVES" href="../../index.html%3Fp=249.html">Chapter 15</a> in <em>Out of Winkler</em>). I experienced what every other person who has been there has experienced: unconditional love, complete lack of judgement, affirmation of who I was and what I was doing on earth during this lifetime, encouragement that I had what it takes to do what I needed to do and to be who I am. So I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span>. I know who I am in God. I know what the afterlife is like. I know God better for this experience. I no longer need to merely believe. As Jung says, &#8220;&#8216;God-awful legalistic religion&#8217; and over-reliance on faith [gets] in the way of <em>gnosis</em>, or direct knowledge of God.&#8221;  (<em>Wounded Healer</em>, p 152).</p>
<blockquote><p>If there is a God you must see him;</p>
<p>If there is a soul we must perceive it;</p>
<p>Otherwise it&#8217;s better not to believe;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to be an outspoken atheist than a hypocrite. (source unknown)</p></blockquote>

			<p>This website is primarily devoted to writing spiritual insights, thoughts, experiences, etc. But I do read a fair amount, and I just finished a book which has little to do with spirituality, but was an impactful book none the less. This novel, written by Neil Gordon, has recently been made into a movie, which is what drew my attention to it. The movie review sounded like this was an interesting story. And boy, is that ever the truth!!</p>
<p>Growing up in the USA, an adolescent in the 1960&#8217;s, I was very affected by all the social unrest happening at the time. While I was never directly involved in much, I was fairly aware of the civil rights movement, the antiwar protests and the like.</p>
<p>This story deals with a few members of what began as the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), a group I was distantly aware of. Then some of the more radical members formed the Weatherman Underground, and began planting bombs and blowing up government buildings in protest to the dominance of the ruling powers. The Weatherman ethics kept them from killing; they timed their explosions to be away from people and times when people were at work.</p>
<p>But of course, their activities were illegal, so many members were forced underground. Many surfaced over the next decades. But the two main characters of this novel remained underground until 1996. The novel takes place in 2006, in attempts to get parole for one of the characters. There are many, many &#8220;flashbacks&#8221;, both to 1996, and to the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Neil Gordon very accurately captures the mood of those earlier decades. Not all of us were actively spending our lives in protest over social injustices, but all of us were certainly impacted by those who did. This story took me right back into those times, telling an inside story of groups I knew only vaguely. But the author gets it right!</p>
<p>It is very well written. His character development is top-notch. I as the reader ended up caring very deeply what happened to these terribly flawed individuals as their lives slowly unfolded through the course of the book.</p>
<p>I would recommend this read to anyone wanting to understand just a little more about the generation of the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s. It is entertaining on many levels, but also very insightful.</p>

			<p>Galatians 5.1 (yes, I quote from the Bible!) says, &#8220;For freedom Christ has freed us. Stand then, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no trouble affirming Church and the task it has played in society over the centuries. It is not an accident that Church was established those many years ago. But there are those who find Church to be quite limiting. I believe this occurs most in people earnestly seeking God and his Spirit.</p>
<p>For myself, I feel I have grown to the place where I really do not need Church anymore. I continue to associate with Church for reasons other than Spiritual growth. I do not believe this puts me into any sort of danger, as some would assume from reading these words. In fact, on the contrary: I would be in graver Spiritual danger if I returned to earlier and more limiting beliefs than I hold now. I feel so free in the place I find myself I am filled with nothing but the most profound gratitude to God for where he has taken me. I am more sure and certain of my spiritual state than I have ever been in my entire life.</p>
<p>Some would think me deluded. I would encourage those ones to consider the biblical example. When Jesus appeared on the scene, his most vigorous opposition came from those who appealed to the Bible as their authority. And since Jesus did not match the scriptural record, he must be of the devil. (For a more in-depth discussion of some of these issues, see my chapter on <a title="CHAPTER NINE – TRUST" href="../../index.html%3Fp=202.html">&#8220;Trust&#8221; in &#8220;Out of Winkler.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>Those today who appeal to the Bible as ultimate authority are the ones from whom I receive the most vigorous resistance to my beliefs. Therefore I consider myself in very good company indeed!!!</p>
<p>Over and over again I am hearing how much of a restriction to freedom organized religion is. I hear this from those who have gone beyond (as in NDE&#8217;s), received profound wisdom, and returned to share with us what they learned. I hear this from those who have devoted the greatest energy in seeking God and his truth. I hear this from those most acutely attuned to the Spirit dimension who hear messages from beyond.</p>
<p>I believe what we are experiencing in society in the present day is more and more freedom to seek truth in ways hitherto not embraced by Organized Religion. I believe God is moving in today&#8217;s world in new and exciting ways. Not &#8220;new&#8221; ways in the sense that we haven&#8217;t seen this before. After all, as I referred to above, Jesus came revealing truth outside of Organized Religion. I think what is &#8220;new&#8221; is the degree to which this is happening. There is almost an exponential growth in people seeking truth outside of Organized Religion. This growth is both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">numerical</span>&#8211;more people than ever before are on this spiritual quest&#8211;but also in spiritual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depth</span>. The truths about God, heaven, the universe, the Source, Spirit, are accumulating and growing deeper all the time.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea where this will lead! Where does all this end up? The passage I quoted above from Galatians, in the Bible, goes on to say that our freedom is to be used to love one another (verses 13,14). Once again, the overwhelming message from heaven is love. We are to establish God&#8217;s presence on earth through the medium of love. It is in loving that we experience God. It is by loving that we show God to those around us.</p>
<p>While Church anticipates some sort of divine interruption to our existence on this planet, we are to be bringing about God&#8217;s authority through love. There is definitely the feeling in the world that a shift is occurring. There is no consensus of how this shift might ultimately happen. It could very well be that there will be some catastrophic events which bring about this shift. But I think it could also occur very quietly as each of us who are being enlightened continue to live faithfully in the freedom to which we have been called. Stand then, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>
