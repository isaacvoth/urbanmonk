					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dennis.  I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I do think God is speaking to us humans at this dawn of a new era, and that truth may not be coming from the religious fundamentalists...in fact it probably is not.  I have been very blessed by keeping an open mind and heart to hear God&#039;s truth from wherever it may come.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Dennis, for me the gospels are important. I am not fan of Paul&#039;s Christianity, nor do I subscribe to literal interpretations of the bible. 
Jesus commanded us to love our fellow man as he does. It was not an option, it was a command. In his teaching, he explained how this was to be accomplished, and he set an example by his own actions. 
Yet still in our modern world, we are loathe to behave as he did, lest we be branded and cast out of the community as he was. Nobody wants to suffer his fate, and that is why we continue to sin, and that is why the world remains an evil and implacable place.]]></description>
