				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Nearly two months ago I posted some thoughts, early in the life of this website blog. I called it, &#8220;Head or heart?&#8221; As I stated there, I continue to be a work-in-progress! I am still mulling all this over.</p>
<p>Our left brain deals with the logical, analytical, thought processes, figuring things out. The right brain deals more with intuition, creativity, sensing, mysticism, just knowing. As I walk my spiritual path, more and more I am depending on right brain sensing.</p>
<p>Some of my fellow travellers do not trust this right brain way of being. They encourage me to remain in line with the creeds and with the ancient writings. &#8220;How will you know if you wander off the path?&#8221; they wonder. What keeps me on the straight-and-narrow? How do I determine right from wrong? What is my standard, my criteria? This is very much left brain thinking.</p>
<p>More and more I am coming to see that when faith and religion become a matter of creeds and theology, God is silenced. By adhering to beliefs we silence God. We no longer need to hear God, to sense him, to intuit him. We have the scriptures and the creeds to inform our faith; we can figure him out, analyze the scriptures and know God this way. And our logical, linear way of thinking once again silences God&#8217;s true voice speaking to our inner being. We need to have both sides of the brain working in order to encounter God.</p>
<p>In the preface to a book I just began reading today, the author expresses the development of religion and faith, both through history, and in individual lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>At different periods in history, spiritual search has been expressed in philosophies, psychologies, arts, and above all in religions; by these ways seekers have been called and helped in sustaining and deepening their quest. With time wayfarers and pilgrims are in general replaced by believers and officials prizing the security of their positions. Rather than the path leading to openness and vulnerability to truth, we find too many frozen statements and doctrines claiming to provide the answers. (&#8220;Whispers from the Other Shore&#8221;, Ravi Ravindra, p. ix)</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again I thank the Divine for sending me wisdom I need right at this moment! I was mulling these thoughts over last evening, just beginning to think I should journal this on <em>Urban Monk</em>, when &#8220;<em>Whispers&#8230;&#8221;</em> arrived in the mail and was left on the table by my wife! The Universe truly works wonders in our lives. The Source of all wisdom synchronizes events in our existence to bring about teaching, learning and growth.</p>
<p>I suspect there will be a fuller review of this little gem of a book in the future. But for now, I hear Spirit telling me I&#8217;m on the right path. I am learning to trust my inner leading, my intuition, as much as I trust my mind. Both halves of the brain are given us by the Creator. Both are necessary to a full life. Neither are to be ignored in favour of the other. Right brain, left brain? Whole brain, no brain? Which is it to be?!!! Don&#8217;t you just love this journey?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Just finished an intriguing book: <em>Paul and Stephen</em>, by Francisco Candido (Chico) Xavier. This book, published by the International Spiritist Council of Brazil, is listed as &#8220;A Novel Dictated by the Spirit, Emmanuel&#8221;. Subtitled, <em>Historic Episodes of Primitive Christianity</em>, it has been &#8220;psychographed&#8221; by Chico Xavier, that is, written down by him. Is this the way some of the biblical documents were written? H-m-m-m!</p>
<p>The book tells the story of Saul of Tarsus, and Stephen, the first martyr of the Christians. It is completely faithful to the sparse details the Bible gives us. It fleshes out the story, giving us a much fuller picture and more complete story of the early years of the followers of Jesus after he was killed. In that way it is a most fascinating story, especially since I have been a student of the scriptures and have known these stories for many years.</p>
<p>My biggest critique has to do with the writing. Since this is a translation from the Portuguese, it is not fair to criticize the author. But the language is overly flowery. Everything is always perfect; everything always works out for the good. Skies are always crystal blue, with gentle breezes blowing. Because of this it gets quite tiring to read. Do angels and spirits not have a sense of good literature?!!</p>
<p>But it was helpful to understand more fully the struggles of the earliest followers of the Way of Jesus. Theirs was not an easy existence. And to see the transformation of Saul the persecutor into Paul the Apostle was marvelous. An interesting detail was that Saul was betrothed to the sister of Stephen, before either of them knew that the Stephen who Saul was persecuting to the point of his stoning death, was actually her brother Jeziel under an assumed name. When she and Saul discovered this, at the time of his death, both were completely overcome with despair and guilt. Understandably this became a very formative event in Saul/Paul&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>So, an interesting read, raising some questions. I hope to be able to read more from this source, about the early Christian days. I have already read <em>Astral City</em> by the same author, a book coming from a doctor in Rio de Janeiro who died, and then began communicating with Chico Xavier about life on the other side. This also is a fascinating account, but very poorly translated. The Portuguese version, <em>Nosso Lar</em>, has been around since the 1940&#8217;s. It illustrates many of the things I have been learning over the past years about death and life on the other side. The video is well worth checking out.</p>

			<p>A spiritual director once said to me, &#8220;Dennis, rest into God.&#8221; Relax. God is in charge. You can rest in that knowledge. &#8220;Come to me all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest&#8221; (Mt 11.28). And he continues, &#8220;. . . you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light&#8221; (vs 29,30).</p>
<p>Granted, there is a sense of restlessness when living the life of Spirit. The Spirit blows where it will, etc. But there is also the sense of rest and relaxation. Our human tendency is to get all wrapped up in intensity. Everything is so important, we have to do it now!</p>
<p>But there really is no true urgency. Because the Divine is in charge. And his burden is light. The task he has given us is easy. We need only learn from him. And rest in him. And as we rest, as we empty our minds of mundanity, we can hear his voice. And his voice is true; it is light. Blessed are they who hear my voice and respond. Let him who has ears to hear, hear what the Spirit says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rest into God!&#8221;</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There is much fear in our society. Fear is fostered, nurtured by the powers-that-be as a means of control. The Bush/Cheney administration in the USA consciously, deliberately introduced elements of fear into society. In fact, fear has been used to keep populaces docile for decades, if not centuries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;The temptation is to listen and absorb the fear messages that you are constantly bombarded with &#8212; by organizations, institutions, politicians, and associations &#8212;  by all forms of human organizations. Yes, even churches &#8212; or we might say, especially churches, for they indeed preach the message of fear. This is highly destructive from the perspective of the spiritual realm. It is highly dysfunctional. It serves to trap humanity in a vicious cycle of trying to fulfill the expectations of others or organizations and not to fulfill your own soul based intentions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This message was received recently by a medium I know. It came from advanced Light-Beings in the heavenly realm. When I read the part about churches I wanted to become defensive. But as I sat back and contemplated what was being said, I realized that there is truth contained in these words. Indeed, insofar as this message is genuine, there cannot be anything <strong><em>but</em></strong> truth in these words.</p>
<p>I had to admit that the Church has been complicit in spreading and maintaining fear in society. I have been part of organized religion all my life, including leadership positions. While I have been fortunate in having been led to very positive-minded churches for the most part, I know enough about Church as a whole that I must admit that the Church has often been guilty of spreading fear. Fear of &#8220;going to hell&#8221;, fear of losing salvation, fear of displeasing God, fear of being fooled by the devil, being led astray, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>In the spiritual realm, there is no cause for fear. One only has to trust the leadership that Spirit gives, and you need not fear. Walk boldly the path laid out for you; do not live in fear.</p>

			<p>Discussed with my son the other day patterns passed on from parents to child. This got my wife and me thinking about what <strong><em>we</em></strong> had learned from <strong><em>our</em></strong> parents. One example: both of us have much more education than either set of parents. Our mothers finished high school; our fathers did not. Both of us have graduate degrees. We were able to recognize that education was valued in our extended families of origin.</p>
<p>Coming from conservative, traditional families, both of us have greatly expanded our horizons. This not only in education; in many areas of life we have been driven to explore the boundaries of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>So much of my life I have pushed against the accepted. Often misunderstood, I have swum upstream, against the flow of those around me. While exciting to live this way, it tends to be a lonely existence!</p>
<p>But I am learning to accept my cross-current path. Spirit is teaching me these days that our lives have been planned (see my book review on <em>Your Soul&#8217;s Plan</em>). I therefore have to assume that the way my life is unfolding is all according to previous decisions. Nothing is an accident. I am also being taught that each one of us is infinitely cared for, watched after, assisted, loved and supported along the way, no matter how rocky the trail.</p>
<p>What tremendous peace results when I live with that awareness. With growing confidence I can step out and walk the path with boldness, however halting my steps may be.</p>
<p>The image of &#8220;monk&#8221; carries with it a sense of solitude. I therefore responded positively when offered the gift of this website name. It resonated with me. It felt right. It helps define who I am. Quiet, alone, slightly mystical, carrying out my duties, submitting to my higher power, not materialistic, seeking knowledge and wisdom. (And I like to sing!!)</p>
<p>So, I am who I am because this is who I chose to be before I was born. This life I chose to live is a gift to me. And I am a gift to the world and to the universe. A gift being opened slowly, one layer at a time.</p>

			<p>With a sense of disbelief, dismay and horror (and a generous dose of humour), I  watch the U.S. Republican primary race. The attacks on women have been unbelievable. These battles (for women&#8217;s rights) were fought and won so long ago. What is happening? Why is there such diabolical hatred being spewed forth against women? Again?</p>
<p>Yesterday I was reminded of a book I had read a year or so ago. <em>Unplugging the Patriarchy</em>, by Lucia René, outlines in allegorical style the story of several women whose task in this life has been a battle on the spiritual plane against some of the powers that rule this world. Their primary target is patriarchy.</p>
<p>These heavenly agents, in human form, battle to undo the powerful hold that patriarchy and other ruling authorities have on global society. In <em>Lord of the Rings</em> language, they destroy the rings of power!</p>
<p>The human race has lived under patriarchy for about five millennia. Patriarchy was set up, at a spiritual level, to aid our development as a people on this planet. It had a useful purpose. But patriarchy has run its course; it is no longer helpful to us. And the spirit realms have sent operatives to fight it, and enable a shift to a more healthy, holistic society.</p>
<p>And what we are seeing today is the fight back of these powers; they will not easily relinquish their strongholds. The news of the day shows us the death throes of the rulers.</p>
<p>This spring&#8217;s Republican attack on women is patriarchy&#8217;s mighty last fight. The financial crisis of 2008 was the beginning of the end for some of the money rulers. At least I hope this is the case!</p>
<p>The warfare is not yet over; more chaos will ensue. But as we live through these uncertain times, each of us is able to assist the battle as we open ourselves to the divine, as we raise our spiritual consciousness, as we become aware of the reality of the ruling powers which want to keep us enslaved.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Just finished reading this book. It is an awesome depiction of how healing it can be to know that you planned your life before you were born, especially in the wake of accidents, major illnesses, deaths, personality disorders, etc. Through presenting a number of cases, Schwartz demonstrates how people were helped through gaining knowledge of their own pre-planning.</p>
<p>While we are still in the Spirit dimension, as souls, we participate with other souls in planning how our life on earth will proceed. The lessons we want to learn, the karma we want to take care of, other souls who will be on earth with us and in what relationship, all are things which are discussed together with our Spirit guides and teachers. Much care and thought is given to what our lives will consist of.</p>
<p>This knowledge alone results in a sense of acceptance and peace about events in our lives. What can seem overwhelming and negative on the physical level can, with a changed perspective, come to be seen as a gift we helped plan. When we become aware of ourselves as love and compassion, and the result of love and compassion, it changes everything.</p>
<p>In Church/Christian settings we often refer to &#8220;God&#8217;s will for our lives&#8221;. We spend a lot of time and energy searching for God&#8217;s will. And we wrestle with submitting to it. Robert Schwartz provides a complementary perspective to all this. This is something all humans on earth live with, our plan, God&#8217;s will, for our lives. We are here for a purpose. We have work to do. We have things to accomplish.</p>
<p>And all of it is for the purpose of a spiritual awakening, both for ourselves and for the entire race, indeed, for the entire universe! Our lives have meaning, deep, profound meaning. We are cared for with infinite love. There are Spirit beings always accessible to us to help us carry out our purpose. They love and support us in every way possible. Their every wish is for our success.</p>
<p>On the human level we often view disastrous events with dismay. We consider them setbacks to our lives, abrupt detours. With the heavenly perspective we can begin to view them with new eyes. We are given obstacles, we <em>plan</em> obstacles, in our lives to give us opportunities for spiritual growth and enlightenment.</p>
<p>There are many means available to us to help gain this perspective. Robert Schwartz has shown us one way this information can be accessed. Soul regression is another way. Shamanism, prayer, meditation, contemplation are all ways which we humans can use to help us understand ourselves as eternal soul beings living a human incarnation on earth for specific purposes.</p>
<p>Thank you Robert, for giving us this account of your own journey in assisting others gain a life-changing perspective on life, on their lives.</p>

			<p>Head or heart? Mind or emotions? Feelings or intellect? Lots of discussion revolves around these. Which one rules you? How do I make my decisions? How do I discern which direction to go? Where does my leading come from?</p>
<p>As I move into a more Spirit-led way of being, I am learning that the age we live in has skewed to the intellectual. Mind takes precedence. We live in the &#8220;Age of Reason&#8221;. We have been trained to trust our minds over our hearts. Feelings have been relegated to secondary status.</p>
<p>I am learning that this is <em>not</em> the way we are intended to live. The mind is supposed to be subservient to the heart, not the other way round. &#8220;As we return to a heart-centered way of being, we remember who we really are.&#8221; (<em>Your Soul&#8217;s Plan, </em>by Robert Schwartz, p 148)</p>
<p>In the Church this debate has long raged. As early as the 1970&#8217;s, in my own life&#8217;s journey, we went through a deliberate stage of learning about the place emotions play in our spirituality. We recognized there had been a serious lack of balance which needed correcting. For myself in that period, while this discussion allowed me to begin to acknowledge the place of emotions in my life, I still very much saw them as secondary to thought. It has only been recently that I have been able to place more importance on heart, following my heart as opposed to doing what makes sense intellectually.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of what goes for orthodox Church theology is determined intellectually. We are constantly encouraged to read and study the scriptures. Yes, we are to pray, but all direction and belief must line up with scripture. When I talk to fellow Christians about following my heart, this is still viewed with great suspicion; it is not to be trusted. In a recent discussion at church, &#8220;experiencing God&#8221; was treated very dismissively. Only &#8220;the word&#8221; was to be trusted. And of course, in his mind, &#8220;the word&#8221; equates with the Bible. And not only the Bible, but his interpretation of the Bible, although he would likely not make that distinction!</p>
<p>Not for me. No longer will I trust my intellect primarily. I want to trust my heart. I want to follow where Spirit leads, even when that seems against what my head might tell me, even when it goes against what I have been taught intellectually from the scriptures. I don&#8217;t delete mind from the equation. My brain is still important. My thoughts, my study, deliberation, are all still part of who I am and where I am going. But obedience to Spirit will take precedence. I make this declaration publicly, knowing that I am still a work in progress. I will no doubt fall short many times. But this is how I plan to live the remainder of my life!!!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The two book reviews published below resulted in some interesting speculation. What are the messages from them? Are there common themes? What is the spirit dimension trying to say to us in 2012? While I am sure both these books will stay with me for awhile, here are some initial reactions:</p>
<p>Both of these books, coming from radically differing perspectives, carry common themes. One is the sense of urgency. We don’t have much time. We humans have created a fine mess here on earth, and it won’t be long before it becomes unsustainable. Another strong theme coming from both these authors is the care for us coming from the spirit dimension. We are cared for; the divine element wants us to succeed, to do well, to survive. Another common message is that it is up to us to listen. “Nothing happens without requesting it,” says Talia from beyond. We must learn to quiet our minds in order to tune in to the spirit world. Help is ours, is available to us, if we only avail ourselves of it. Another message from these books is that nothing happens to us by accident. Every trial, every pain we experience, is there for a reason. It is yet another lesson for us to learn from. We grow through what we experience.</p>
<p>What amazes me is how consistent these messages are with messages from other sources. My own background in the Christian Church, while differing at some key points, is strongly in agreement with all of this. My experiences in soul regression (which I will be writing about here in the future) are also along completely compatible lines. People, there is hope!!!</p>

<p>Just finished reading two books over the weekend. The first one I had been reading over a period of time, as it’s that sort of book – one you want to savour, contemplate, and wonder about. The second I had only recently heard about, checked it out of our local library, and read very quickly.</p>
<p><em>The Universe Speaks: A Heavenly Dialogue</em>, Kimberly Klein, 2011.</p>
<p>The author’s 13 year old daughter, Talia, was killed in an airplane crash, along with her father and the pilot, in Panama in Dec, 2008. One month later Talia communicated to a family friend to let her mom know she was okay. This friend, called “G” in the book, continued to hear Talia’s communications from “the other side”. She told him to write these down, and to publish them for the world to read. What follows are the first half-year of these communications. She is basically teaching G what the heavenly realm wants humanity to know. There is a sense of urgency in these messages; the time is short. G goes through a lot of self-doubt that he is actually hearing Talia, that he is hearing her accurately, and that he has the ability to communicate these lessons to the world. Talia continually reassures him that what he is doing is good, and the right thing.</p>
<p>One thing that amazed me was the biblical language used by Talia, since she and her mother lived a non-religious life. I was so intrigued by this use of biblical imagery that I emailed Kimberly Klein to ask if perhaps G had a religious bent. She replied that no, he did not, no more than she and Talia had, but that he had recently picked up a Bible for the first time shortly before Talia’s death, and had read it. Kimberly thinks that the immediacy of G’s reading the Bible may have contributed to the spirit dimension communicating to him in biblical language. Spirit always relates to us in accessible terms.</p>
<p><em>Solving the Communion Enigma: What is to Come</em>, Whitley Strieber, 2011.</p>
<p>In the mid-eighties Whitley Strieber had published an account of his abduction by unknown, and non-human, entities, called <em>Communion</em>. After some initial interest and furor over his experiences, he found himself marginalized by society. This experience pretty much wrecked his life. He continued to publish both fiction and non-fiction books, always based on para-normal occurrences.</p>
<p>Now, 25 years after its publication, he attempts to further understand, and explain to us, the implications of his earlier experiences. What he concludes is that these experiences were not sinister in nature. In fact, he sees them now as the beginning of a schooling for him.</p>
<p>The lessons he learned, and that he shares with the wider community of humans, are profound. We are being looked after by others. There definitely is much more to our existence than our material world. We are being taught how to survive on this planet. Things are urgent enough that if we don’t learn our lessons soon, we will not be able to continue living here. And these “others”, whoever, and whatever they may be, are completely committed to helping us through.</p>
<p>We are cared for and loved. Communications from them are not direct, but rather enigmatic. Things like crop circles, cattle mutilations, human abductions, implants, etc, are done for specific reasons. If they were to communicate openly and directly to us, we would come to rely on them, ceasing to use our own intellectual powers to solve our problems. But they are overseeing and guiding us as we seek to get ourselves out of the mess we have created on earth.</p>
