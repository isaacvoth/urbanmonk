Initially, of course, this was by LP&#8217;s. \u00a0In the 70&#8217;s I went through a few years of cassette tapes, though I never saw this as my primary method of replaying music I enjoyed. While the 80&#8217;s saw me gradually shifting to CD&#8217;s, I was still searching for LP&#8217;s. Now, of course, with the advent of digital music all has shifted. But I still own quite a collection of both LP&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s. Many of my favourites I have changed over to digital and will put various playlists of music onto my iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>I was listening to a large playlist a few weeks ago of folk, pop and early rock-and-roll. With over 900 tracks on this playlist, songs don&#8217;t come up all that often. A Dan Fogelberg song came on which I had not heard in quite some time, years probably. I own only one of his albums,\u00a0<em>High Country Snows<\/em> and\u00a0have always enjoyed this album. The song I heard that day was called,\u00a0<em>The Higher You Climb<\/em>. The words struck me as reflecting my own journey in some way.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The higher you climb, the more that you see;<\/p>\n<p>The more that you see, the less that you know;<\/p>\n<p>The less that you know, the more that you yearn;<\/p>\n<p>The more that you yearn, the higher you climb.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There is another verse, but this is the one which spoke to me. Listen to the words: <em>the more that you see, the less that you know<\/em>. It would seem that the more you see, the more you should know. But no, the more you see, the <em>less<\/em> you know. As I have climbed higher and higher in a spiritual sense, I know I can see more and better than ever in my life. Yet, it seems often that the more I see and learn, the less I know!!<\/p>\n<p>For my self this can only be explained as the more I see and understand of the spiritual dimensions the more I realize there is to know. And in relation to that increased realization, I know less than before, proportionally, even though I know so much more!!!<\/p>\n<p>It is an exciting concept!! I know that we will move into eternity continually learning and learning. We will climb higher and higher, always seeing more, and realizing there is so much more to know, yearning to see and know more and more!! I love it. I thank you Dan for encapsulating a simple truth so artistically!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the years I have collected many albums of music.
