This weekend was wonderful for me! Saturday began with a little flight in my airplane over the Rockies to Invermere, B.C. This was something I had been wanting to do for a long time. Flying in and over the mountains is a very different feeling than flying out over the prairies. Over the prairies there seem to be endless landing possibilities in the event of a crisis. In the mountains, watch out! Anyway, made it without incident, had a cup of coffee at the local Super 8, flew back. Returning I encountered considerably more clouds than outbound, so had to fly quite high, up to 14,000 feet, to avoid them. But it was a great feeling of accomplishment!<\/p>\n<p>So, a positive start to the weekend. Then home, lunch, nap, and mowed the front lawn. At my house this is quite an undertaking, it being almost as much vertical as horizontal!! Cleaned out some grass and weeds around some trees, and then tackled my fence. We are contemplating building a deck in a few weeks, and my decrepit old fence has to go for that. It had to go anyway, as it was in danger every big wind we had! Got a little over half of it down.<\/p>\n<p>So Saturday was a day full of physical work. It felt great! Also, I am on a restrictive diet and have been operating at very low energy for quite a few weeks. That I was able to accomplish as much as I did with such low energy felt like a huge deal!<\/p>\n<p>Sunday morning, traditionally a Church day for me, I spent on the internet, catching up on numerous spirituality websites I more-or-less keep track of. And it was wonderful! The overall impression I am receiving right now is quite optimistic. It seems to be the consensus that May and before was a difficult time for many spiritual people. But June is seen as bringing in more light and positive stuff. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, spiritually. Things may look dark on the physical plane, but in the spiritual realms things are happening. There is definitely the sense that a shift is occurring.<\/p>\n<p>This shift has been foretold for a long time now. At first many anticipated it would happen at the change of ages predicted in the\u00a0Mayan calendar. This prediction was usually thought by scholars to be the winter solstice of 2012. Nothing really happened then. At least nothing visible, nothing &#8220;big&#8221;, or noticeable. There was some understandable disappointment over that. But the sun keeps coming up in the morning, so we have to go on.<\/p>\n<p>This would accord with my opinion that setting the Mayan calendar date so precisely was a big mistake. It was based on scholars interpreting some very mysterious and enigmatic carvings on ancient ruins of the Mayan culture. I felt it was a mistake to pin it down to our own modern Julian calendar so closely.<\/p>\n<p>Now the thinking is that the next few months promise significant events to occur. Will this have the same outcome? Will there be noticeable shifts, or disappointing sameness? I don&#8217;t know. Huge grains of salt are needed to take any of this seriously, until events actually begin occurring. However, for me personally, my past weekend certainly makes me feel that my own spirit is in accord with what I am reading from various outside sources. I resonate with the opinion that the months leading up to September will be significant. Hang on! The ride may be interesting!!!
