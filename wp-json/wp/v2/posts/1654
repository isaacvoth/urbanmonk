Therefore we are quite interested in US politics; we watched the fascinating campaign last fall avidly. Our favourite place for political news ended up being MSNBC. A frequent commentator there was Nicolle Wallace. I always appreciated what she had to say. She seemed very knowledgeable and insightful.<\/p>\n<p>Also, as an outspoken Republican in a mostly liberal-minded environment, her take on events was a welcome alternative to the usual opinions. She was one of only a handful of Republicans regularly appearing on that network.<\/p>\n<p>At some point she mentioned in passing \u00a0a novel of hers. Immediately my interest was piqued. I sought out the information on this and discovered that Wallace has written a trilogy of novels, all centring around the White House.<\/p>\n<p>These three novels are titled,\u00a0<em>Eighteen Acres<\/em>,\u00a0<em>It&#8217;s Classified<\/em>, and\u00a0<em>Madam President<\/em>. They follow the same characters through several years. They are a fascinating peek into the life of a president and White House staff.<\/p>\n<p>When I began to realize that Nicolle Wallace herself had spent numerous years in the White House and was intricately involved in Republican politics, I give the stories a lot of credibility. She knows whereof she speaks!!<\/p>\n<p>She was a White House communications director under George W. Bush. She served as a senior advisor for the McCain-Palin campaign of 2008. Her husband is a former ambassador to the United Nations.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;d say she is eminently qualified to speak of Washington politics!!<\/p>\n<p>I will not go into any detail of the contents of the trilogy of novels. The books should be quite accessible; I had no trouble accessing them up here in Canada!!! But I will encourage anyone with even a bit of curiosity of what goes on behind the scenes in the White House to check these books out. They are well worth it. They are not long; they are written in fairly light style. An average reader can breeze through one in a day if you wish. And they are that gripping. Once you start, you are hooked!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My wife and I both grew up in the USA.
