She\u2019s dealing with a lot of backlash from the Mormons around her, and one person in particular (who she\u2019s very close with) now thinks she\u2019s given her soul to Satan and must be re-converted to Mormonism and \u2018saved\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>She says she\u2019s practically had to hide the spiritual articles she reads on the internet, and she feels unloved by the people around her who don\u2019t accept that she\u2019s exited Mormonism and embraced a broader understanding of spirituality.<\/p>\n<p>Like I\u2019ve said before, no belief system determines our spiritual \u2018worthiness\u2019 or our ability to go to heaven. It doesn\u2019t matter if we follow contemporary religion, the ascension movement, eastern spiritual philosophers, etc. We\u2019re all trying to go to the same place, and what we do with our beliefs is far more important than what our beliefs actually are.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll venture as far as to say that the beliefs we have really aren\u2019t important. It really doesn\u2019t matter if you believe that there\u2019s a bearded man up in the sky or that a self-professed \u2018prophet\u2019 received a bunch of scrolls from \u2018God\u2019 that he used to form a religion.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if you think this planet and its people are about to experience a full-on collective evolution from the third to fifth dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>You can be Christian, Catholic, Mormon, Hindu, Muslim, New-Agey \u2013 none of it matters. Humans have established belief systems for the purpose of using them to understand spirit in a greater way, but the belief systems themselves really aren\u2019t important.<\/p>\n<p>Why aren\u2019t they important, you ask? Because they\u2019re only\u00a0<em>beliefs.\u00a0<\/em>They\u2019re ideas we created so we could glimpse what no man has glimpsed, and when we\u2019re in a higher state of consciousness (what some religions call \u2018heaven\u2019) we\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s nothing like we thought or imagined on earth.<\/p>\n<p>This goes for every belief system, whether they\u2019re religious or generally spiritual. For example \u2013 those of us who are heavily involved in the ascension movement believe that the Company of Heaven exists and is guiding humanity along our physical and spiritual evolution.<\/p>\n<p>When we reach a higher state of consciousness, however, we\u2019ll probably find that life there is absolutely nothing like we expected. We\u2019ll see that the Company of Heaven is indeed real, but all of our limited, preconceptions about them will be shattered.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be said for religion.\u00a0<em>Everyone\u00a0<\/em>on this planet who reaches the higher realms will realize that they\u2019re unperceivable and indescribable with our limited human understanding. We can only understand heaven when we\u2019re in heaven, and no belief system is 100% accurate.<\/p>\n<p>We humans are doing the best we can to interpret the higher realms, but when we\u2019re actually there, we\u2019ll find that all of our interpretations fell short. This, in my opinion, is why belief systems aren\u2019t inherently important, and they certainly aren\u2019t an excuse for self-righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>This takes us back to our reader\u2019s problem. I don\u2019t want to sound harsh here, but she\u2019s basically dealing with a group of people (and one person in particular) who are so entrenched in their spiritual beliefs that they can\u2019t accept that she believes something different.<\/p>\n<p>These particular people are so assured that their beliefs are the right ones that they even think other belief systems (such as the ascension movement) have been designed by Satan in an attempt to take Mormons off of their paths.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a harsh level of close-mindedness, and with this mindset, I don\u2019t think humanity will get very far in our spiritual exploration. I\u2019m not trying to pick on religion, and a believer in ascension and the Company of Heaven could easily express the same self-righteousness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of seekers have.<\/p>\n<p>How many \u2018conscious\u2019 people have fallen into the same trap: fixing themselves on their beliefs and telling others who think differently that they\u2019re \u2018wrong\u2019? This problem isn\u2019t just with religion, but religion seems to be its biggest employer.<\/p>\n<p>The issue here isn\u2019t religion or spirituality \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that humanity can\u2019t accept one another. You\u2019ve heard the phrase \u2018never discuss religion or politics\u2019, and this is exactly why. As individuals, some of us are so convinced that our beliefs, our ideologies are the only correct ones, that we can\u2019t accept others for believing different things.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what you believe, if you can\u2019t accept another person for who they are and how they feel, that reflects on you. Whatever religious or spiritual belief you have is just a scapegoat for your hatred, judgment, and condemnation, and to judge or condemn in the name of spirituality is to hold yourself back more than you would\u2019ve ever thought possible.<\/p>\n<p>God doesn\u2019t want us to fight over our respective interpretations of Him\/Her. God wants us to love, respect, and help each other, and I\u2019d imagine He\/She especially wants us to support each other spiritually. Personally, I don\u2019t understand how anyone who claims to have an advanced religious\/spiritual perspective can descend into judgment and hatred.<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, it baffles me. How do so many religious souls still not understand that what they do with their beliefs is more important than the beliefs themselves? How has humanity still not opened up to the idea that love and acceptance are all that are required to get into heaven?<\/p>\n<p>I feel for our reader, who\u2019s made to think she\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019 for thinking differently than the people around her, but their condemnation says something about them, not her. I\u2019m sure our reader doesn\u2019t go around claiming Mormonism and other religions are \u2018wrong\u2019, so why should she (or anyone else) be told she\u2019s wrong?<\/p>\n<p>Our actions will always be more important than the beliefs they\u2019re bred from. If Mormonism or any other religion gives someone incentive to act judgmental or self-righteous, then that person should look within and find what\u2019s missing before they can live in harmony.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could offer more advice to our reader, but the best advice I can give is not to let the condemnation of others get her down.<\/p>\n<p>Millions of formerly religious people who were just like her have exited (or rather, broadened) their faiths when discovering spirituality and the ascension movement, and nobody should have to feel like their interpretations of God or heaven aren\u2019t good enough, because every interpretation is distorted.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve said about all I can on this subject, and I hope our reader\u2019s able to find some lenience from the people around her.<\/p>\n<p>This problem is all too common with religion, general spirituality, and even atheism, and small-mindedness is one of the biggest obstacles on our path to collective enlightenment. I envision a world where people can live in harmony and respect each other\u2019s interpretations of God and heaven, but until that day comes, we clearly have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n<p>Wes Annac \u2013 Ready to see humanity transcend our unproductive ways of division and hatred.<\/p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m a 21 year old awakening seeker and creator of\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/cultureofawareness.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Culture of Awareness<\/a><em>\u00a0daily news site.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Culture of Awareness<em>\u00a0features daily spiritual and alternative news, as well as articles I\u2019ve written and more<\/em>.\u00a0<em>Its purpose is to awaken and uplift by providing material that\u2019s spiritually inspired and\/or related to the fall of the planetary elite and our entrance into a positive future.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I can also be found at\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/wesannac.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Conscious Oneness<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/goldenageofgaia.com\/author\/wes-annac\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Golden Age of Gaia<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/lightworkers.org\/user\/36129\" target=\"_blank\">Lightworkers.org<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/www.ashtarcommandcrew.net\/profile\/WesA'\" target=\"_blank\">Ashtar Command Crew<\/a>, Facebook (<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wes.annac\" target=\"_blank\">Wes Annac<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aquariusparadigm\" target=\"_blank\">The Culture of Awareness<\/a>), and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/p.feedblitz.com\/t3.asp?\/715643\/28676887\/4773186\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/WesAnnac\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The following article is reprinted with permission from the author.
