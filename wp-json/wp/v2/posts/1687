The Trump era continues to provide fodder for the mill. Just about every day there is some new and disturbing thing he does to give us all pause.<\/p>\n<p>Just a couple notes, from the entertainment industry:<\/p>\n<p>One: here is a quote from one of the greatest rock musicians ever, Robert Plant. In an interview about his latest album,\u00a0<em>Carry Fire<\/em>, Plant mentions Trump as an inspiration for one of his songs. But, &#8220;It&#8217;s not just Trump. It&#8217;s every Trump that&#8217;s ever been. Every generation and every culture has several Trumps. It&#8217;s just some are a bit heftier than others. And you&#8217;ve got one hell of a heft over there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Two: I recently read an interview with the screenwriter for the\u00a0<em>Back to the Future<\/em> movies of the eighties. This writer, way back in the early eighties, used Donald Trump as a model for his character, Biff. Biff was a bully in these movies. Everything he did was for his own advancement. He cared nothing for anyone else. Like Robert Plant said above, every generation has these characters. We can all recognize them in the Biffs and the Trumps of our time. That a screenwriter recognized this decades before Donald Trump ever ran for public office is very telling indeed. Trump&#8217;s character has been consistent from the beginning. He hasn&#8217;t changed his stripes. He has been a narcissistic bully from day one. He has never grown up, or grown beyond the person he was as a young man. In fact, I have heard several commentators refer to him as a &#8220;man-boy&#8221;, or even a &#8220;man-baby&#8221;. He has the demeanour, and intelligence, of an immature person.<\/p>\n<p>The truly scary aspect of all this is the position he has found himself in. Here we have a truly immature narcissist in one of the most powerful positions in the world. My feeling, watching this ongoing circus called the Trump administration, is that he cares so little for anyone beyond himself and his family, and he has such abysmally little understanding of the consequences of his actions, that he could unthinkingly plunge us all into oblivion.<\/p>\n<p>We do indeed have, &#8220;. . . one hell of a heft . . .&#8221; on our hands.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sorry, folks, but I&#8217;ve got to do it!!
