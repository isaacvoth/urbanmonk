I hear messages from many sources, and they&#8217;re not always in step with each other. There are some who predict great changes as we approach the winter solstice of 2018. (And I recognize that calling it the &#8220;winter&#8221; solstice is very North American biased!!)<\/p>\n<p>Looking around at the world today, there is great turmoil. There is great divisiveness. There is great uncertainty. Where are we going? Where will we end up? What will we need to endure in the next little while?<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in the midst of all this confusion there are voices proclaiming great and positive changes coming soon. And many of these, might I say, psychic, voices are sounding very positive. It is difficult to resolve all this, to come to grips with what is really on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>The positive messages mainly surround topics like &#8220;disclosure&#8221; and &#8220;ascension&#8221;. There are numerous ones who say this world will not be allowed to enter nuclear war. There are some who say the world will not be allowed to destroy itself. There are beings overseeing our world and they care deeply what happens to it.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these messages I have been hearing for years. And for years I have been hearing that we as a planet, as a human race, are moving ahead in a spiritual sense, that we are evolving, growing, improving. Watching the evening news brings decidedly other scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>So I end up, as we approach the end of 2018, dazed and confused. I don&#8217;t know what the right message, the most correct interpretation is. Which way will we go, as individuals and as a collective? I do feel a sense of expectation, curiosity, mostly positive anticipation of what may come. But I also feel it may not be an easy time. There may be intense difficulties ahead.
