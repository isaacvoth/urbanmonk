What is the core of Christianity? Where is the heart of religion? Did Jesus come to establish a religion?<\/p>\n<p>I find looking back on my religious\/spiritual life that I have been very gradually moving from belief to experience. &#8220;Very gradually,&#8221; although sometimes in huge leaps, other times enduring long dry plateaus. &#8220;Gradually&#8221; is the overall view provided by the long look back over time!<\/p>\n<p>On a recently-watched video of a BBC interview* with Carl Jung he was asked about his belief in God. He stated he had some trouble with that word, &#8220;believe&#8221;. &#8220;I know, I don&#8217;t need to believe. I know,&#8221; he replied. If someone <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">knows<\/span> God, if someone has experienced the Divine, has experienced the Spirit realm, there is no need to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">believe<\/span> in it, or him. There is direct knowledge. This statement from one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century helped clear things up for me. It went a long way to explaining my own path, my current position.<\/p>\n<p>Early Church experiences in the 1970&#8217;s (see <a title=\"CHAPTER TWO \u2013 CHARISMATICA\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2012\/05\/08\/chapter-two-charismatica\/\">Chapter 2, <em>Out of Winkler<\/em><\/a>, for example) had started me on the journey of experiencing God, as opposed to only a rational belief in him. Gradually I began realizing how limiting dogma is. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I think, at the beginning of one&#8217;s walk, that doctrine, scripture, etc, are a help along the way. I certainly value highly my own biblical training. It still informs me. I have not rejected previous training and experiences; rather, I have built on them, and continue to build on them. However, increasingly I realize, as Jung says, &#8220;Religion is a defense against religious experience.&#8221; (<em>Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul<\/em>, Claire Dunne, p 152). In a letter to a friend, Jung says, &#8220;People speak of belief when they have lost knowledge. Belief and disbelief in God are mere surrogates.&#8221; (<em>Wounded Healer<\/em>, p 153).<\/p>\n<p>More and more I am encountering this idea: that experience and direct knowledge supersedes belief. For example, in my recently-reviewed book by <a title=\"Anita Moorjani\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2013\/01\/27\/anita-moorjani\/\">Anita Moorjani<\/a>, I find the following quotes: &#8220;Instead, letting go of attachment to any way of believing or thinking has made me feel more expanded and almost transparent so that universal energy can just flow through me.&#8221; (p 160.) &#8220;So these days, I don&#8217;t follow any established methodology, order, ritual, dogma, or doctrine. . . . For me, life is a spiritual experience, and I&#8217;m changing and evolving all the time.&#8221; (p 154). &#8220;To advocate any option or doctrine as being the one true way would only serve to limit who we are and what we&#8217;ve come here to be.&#8221; (p 155).<\/p>\n<p>Again, from another <a title=\"Eben Alexander\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2013\/04\/29\/eben-alexander\/\">recent review<\/a>: &#8220;At last, I understood what religion was really all about. Or at least was supposed to be about. I didn\u2019t just believe in God; I knew God.&#8221; (<em>Proof of Heaven<\/em>, Eben Alexander, p 147).<\/p>\n<p>It is almost precisely two years ago that I had my own profound experience of the Divine. I had my first soul regression session, and was gently ushered into the Spirit realm. (See especially, <a title=\"CHAPTER FIFTEEN \u2013 BETWEEN LIVES\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2012\/06\/30\/chapter-fifteen-between-lives\/\">Chapter 15<\/a> in <em>Out of Winkler<\/em>). I experienced what every other person who has been there has experienced: unconditional love, complete lack of judgement, affirmation of who I was and what I was doing on earth during this lifetime, encouragement that I had what it takes to do what I needed to do and to be who I am. So I <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">know<\/span>. I know who I am in God. I know what the afterlife is like. I know God better for this experience. I no longer need to merely believe. As Jung says, &#8220;&#8216;God-awful legalistic religion&#8217; and over-reliance on faith [gets] in the way of <em>gnosis<\/em>, or direct knowledge of God.&#8221; \u00a0(<em>Wounded Healer<\/em>, p 152).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If there is a God you must see him;<\/p>\n<p>If there is a soul we must perceive it;<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise it&#8217;s better not to believe;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s better to be an outspoken atheist than a hypocrite.
