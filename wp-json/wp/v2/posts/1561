This is one of those books which can be quite perturbing. &#8220;Perturbation&#8221;, defined as: &#8220;anxiety; mental uneasiness;\u00a0a deviation of a system, moving object, or process from its regular or normal state of path, caused by an outside influence&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It certainly caused some &#8220;mental uneasiness&#8221;, in the sense that I don&#8217;t quite know what to do with this story and the information it contains. It is definitely worth reading, if that is what you as the reader of this review is wondering! Just be prepared to encounter ideas which will cause some &#8220;deviation . . . from [your] normal state of path . . . !&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Suzy Hansen is an experiencer. She began as an abductee, then a contactee, but as an adult, became an experiencer. That is, she experiences alien ET&#8217;s, and interacts with them, learning from them.<\/p>\n<p>The first part of the book outlines a growing awareness of her experience with aliens. She does a good job of gradually revealing things as she herself became aware. At the beginning she has these encounters with UFO&#8217;s, not understanding them, or why she seems to have a fairly large number of them. These encounters often have an unsettling influence on her life, as friends and partners cannot understand or accept these events.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spoiler Alert!!!<\/b> If you would like to experience the gradual revelations of Suzy&#8217;s life as she presents them in the book, read no further in this review!!!<\/p>\n<p>Only later in life does Suzy begin sessions with a regression therapist and is able to recover many memories which had previously been hidden from her consciousness. The second part of the book, the majority of it, outlines what she had learned from aliens in previous encounters. When the encounters occurred her memory would be wiped clean when she returned to her human life. This was done, not in any sinister sense, but out of compassion for her. Her memories were always there, but remained hidden until she was at a place where she could handle and understand them. And when the world was more ready to receive her experiences and the information she was being taught.<\/p>\n<p>This is where my own perturbation comes in. The things Suzy experiences are very much akin to what others have experienced through NDE&#8217;s, OBE&#8217;s, and other spiritual journeys. Only, in Suzy&#8217;s case, her experiences of overwhelming love and peace, come to her via alien ET&#8217;s, not through &#8220;angels&#8221;, at least not as I have thought of angels up till now.<\/p>\n<p>I cannot go into great detail on all of Suzy&#8217;s experiences and the knowledge she gained. There is a tremendous amount of it in this book, 300 plus pages in fact!<\/p>\n<p>One thing she discusses at some length, an issue that she encountered at various stages of her own growing awareness, is the issue of disclosure. When will the alien races reveal their agenda to the world at large? Why is so much of their work done in secret, to only a few? \u00a0As best I could tell from Suzy&#8217;s story is that there is tremendous care being taken on the part of the ET&#8217;s to prevent calamity on earth. Human society is not presently in a state to be able to handle the information of alien interactions with this planet. There is definitely interest being taken by aliens in what happens on earth; there is a great deal of concern that things develop as planned. They want us to grow, to increase in consciousness, to join the wider body of universal inhabitants. But until we as a race are prepared to accept their involvement and interest in us, they will remain hidden.<\/p>\n<p>They reveal themselves to only a select few, whom they have slowly trained and prepared to accept this contact. As more and more humans experience interactions of this sort, disclosure will gradually occur. But they won&#8217;t reveal themselves until we are ready for it.<\/p>\n<p>So many abductees have reported their experiences in a negative light that reading Suzy&#8217;s story is extremely refreshing and encouraging. Apparently there are a considerable number of humans who have been undergoing training of the sort that Suzy has. In fact, Suzy discovered as her memories grew in detail, that she herself is a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; of some sort, having both a human and an alien component. She is a &#8220;dual-soul&#8221;. One of her two sons is also a dual soul, but her other is not. There is much about all this which I do not understand, but I am encouraged that there is much, much care being taken by entities not originally from this planet (&#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">extra<\/span>-terrestrials&#8221;) toward us as a human race living on planet Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Among some of the many things Suzy has learned from these ET&#8217;s is that Earth will enter a stage of disruption as we go through a transition toward taking our place in the universe. This will not be a pleasant time. There will be much hardship. &#8220;The thing to remember is that\u00a0<em>you will eventually reach the destination.<\/em> Patience is necessary.&#8221; (p 313)<\/p>\n<p>The book ends with these words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A powerful longing is stirring in people: a desire for change.<\/p>\n<p>We are not alone. We have never been alone. Look up at the sky on a brilliant starry night and ask yourself, how could we be?<\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, a commitment to positive transformation is building momentum on our planet, and beyond, and it is up to each of us to make the choice to become a part of it, and eventually, take our place in a wider cosmic community, in a universe teeming with life. (p 315)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If these words speak to you, read this book. &#8220;It is a masterpiece&#8221;, (as Dr. Rudy Schild, an astrophysicist who supplies scientific comments about Suzy&#8217;s experiences, says). This book is not for everyone. There will be many who discount it, scoff at it, disbelieve it in many ways, but for a select few, this book will speak volumes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Dual Soul Connection: The Alien Agenda For Human Advancement, by Suzy Hansen.
