When we experience the after-life, the Spirit dimension, we experience it in a way which is accessible for us, understandable and comfortable. This delightful little book is about a delightful little boy who had a near-death experience. He experienced heaven in a way completely consistent with being four years old.<\/p>\n<p>He also has been raised in a Church\/Christian environment, so his experience was entirely consistent with this\u00a0milieu. His father is a pastor in a small, western-Nebraska town.<\/p>\n<p>Colton Burpo, approaching his fourth birthday, complained of a stomach ache. Several recurrences of this stomach ache, a couple trips to the doctor, finally resulted in emergency surgery for a burst appendix. Although Colton was extremely sick and the parents realized they almost lost him, there was no indication of him actually clinically dying.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, a few months later, the parents were caught completely by surprise when Colton began talking about his experience of angels, Jesus, and heaven. While aware of the phenomenon of near-death experiences, here in their own four-year-old son it was difficult to accept. Details emerged over a period of months and years following, as occasionally Colton would come up with statements which would catch his parents off-guard.<\/p>\n<p>At one point Todd, Colton&#8217;s father, wanting to ascertain the validity of his son&#8217;s experience, asked him about going to heaven. &#8220;You said you went to heaven. People have to die to go to heaven.&#8221; Colton&#8217;s gaze didn&#8217;t waver. &#8220;Well, okay then. I died. But just for a little bit.&#8221; (p 79) After mulling this over the father, &#8220;. . . realized that Colton, in telling me he had died &#8216;for a little bit,&#8217; had only been trying to match up his pastor-dad&#8217;s assertion with what he knew to be the facts of his own experience.&#8221; (p 80)<\/p>\n<p>Colton had many experiences in heaven. He met John the Baptist (&#8220;. . . he was really nice.&#8221; p 63), saw Jesus&#8217; horse, many angels, had to do homework, saw Jesus&#8217; markers (stigmata), and much more. Again, Todd wanted to put things into perspective. &#8220;&#8216;Colton, you said you were in heaven and you did all these things . . . \u00a0a <em>lot<\/em>\u00a0of things. How long were you gone?&#8217; My little boy looked me right in the eye and didn&#8217;t hesitate. &#8216;Three minutes,&#8217; he said. Then he hopped down from the chair and skipped off to play.&#8221; (p 76)\u00a0Todd had to realize that in heaven time is very different than we experience on earth.<\/p>\n<p>I could go on and on. This book is full of delightful stories. It is so refreshing to hear deep spiritual things from a child&#8217;s perspective. I recommend this read to anyone, but especially Christians. <em>Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy&#8217;s Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back<\/em>, by Todd Burpo.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Source, God, is completely gracious, wise and accepting.
