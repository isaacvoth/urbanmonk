This got my wife and me thinking about what <strong><em>we<\/em><\/strong> had learned from <strong><em>our<\/em><\/strong> parents. One example: both of us have much more education than either set of parents. Our mothers finished high school; our fathers did not. Both of us have graduate degrees. We were able to recognize that education was valued in our extended families of origin.<\/p>\n<p>Coming from conservative, traditional families, both of us have greatly expanded our horizons. This not only in\u00a0education; in many areas of life we have been driven to explore the\u00a0boundaries\u00a0of orthodoxy.<\/p>\n<p>So much of my life I have pushed against the accepted. Often misunderstood, I have swum upstream, against the flow of those around me. While exciting to live this way, it tends to be a lonely existence!<\/p>\n<p>But I am learning to accept my cross-current path. Spirit is teaching me these days that our lives have been planned (see my book review on <em>Your Soul&#8217;s Plan<\/em>). I therefore have to assume that the way my life is unfolding is all according to previous decisions. Nothing is an accident. I am also being taught that each one of us is infinitely cared for, watched after, assisted, loved and supported along the way, no matter how rocky the trail.<\/p>\n<p>What tremendous peace results when I live with that awareness. With growing confidence I can step out and walk the path with boldness, however halting my steps may be.<\/p>\n<p>The image of &#8220;monk&#8221; carries with it a sense of solitude. I therefore responded positively when offered the gift of this website name. It resonated with me. It felt right. It helps define who I am. Quiet, alone, slightly mystical, carrying out my duties, submitting to my higher power, not materialistic, seeking knowledge and wisdom. (And I like to sing!!)<\/p>\n<p>So, I am who I am because this is who I chose to be before I was born. This life I chose to live is a gift to me. And I am a gift to the world and to the universe. A gift being opened slowly, one layer at a time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Discussed with my son the other day patterns passed on from parents to child.
