I was driving\/working late, receiving updates from my wife about how the results were going. At the beginning Roy Moore was running ahead, by as much as 10 percentage points. I was so discouraged. &#8220;When will we learn to not keep electing scuzzy men?&#8221; It just seemed like more of what we&#8217;ve experienced in the past. People keep getting elected not for the strength of their character, but for their political connections. I was really very depressed.<\/p>\n<p>As I continued to get election updates, Doug Jones began to move closer in the results. I thought, oh, perhaps there is some hope! But I didn&#8217;t want to get my hopes too high because I had been disappointed too often in the past. So it was with very guarded hopes that I hurried home after work.<\/p>\n<p>By the time I arrived home, my wife had texted that they were tied at 49%. I fixed myself some food, and settled down in front of the TV. As the evening wore on, I became more and more excited!! And when Jones won by quite a large margin, over 20,000 votes, I was over-the-moon positive!!!<\/p>\n<p>As I listened to news commentators, I dampened my response a bit, realizing that Moore had been a very damaged candidate, and his demise was not necessarily a sign of things to come, a sign of a significant shift in the US political scene. But still, for a Democrat to get elected in a solidly Republican state like Alabama, signalled that there are some people who still take their democratic responsibility seriously.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was with vastly swinging emotions that we followed the election in Alabama of a US Senator.
