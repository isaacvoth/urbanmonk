Mack, M. D., proved to be an interesting read! I admit, I did not read the entire large volume, but rather picked and chose what I sensed were essential chapters. The first two introduced the subject, the last summed up. In between were 13 case studies at great depth and detail of people who had experienced abductions. I did not read all of these, but enough to understand Dr. Mack&#8217;s methods of using hypnosis to help his clients recall their experiences.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing I learned from this quick read-through is the surprising (to me) correlation of abductee&#8217;s experiences being very similar to other out-of-body experiences. I have commented elsewhere on the uniformity and consistency of lessons learned through various types of experiences. The abductee experience is one more in this list. Abductees experience the love and care which other-worldly creatures have for us humans. Experiencers sense the peacefulness of the spirit realm, many to the extent of not wanting to return to their human lives on earth. They learn of heaven&#8217;s concern with the state of the earth&#8217;s climate, both physical and political. And they come away from these experiences with a sense that they are to play a role in ameliorating earth&#8217;s troublesome condition.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that many abductees have negative reactions, especially at the beginning. But most have had many experiences, and as they gradually become accustomed to them, they begin to accept and adapt, learning the lessons.<\/p>\n<p>There will be more to come on this topic, as a book which arrived while I was still into Mack&#8217;s book, also deals with the topic of abduction. I would also refer the reader to an earlier book I read, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2015\/12\/13\/dual-soul-connection\/\">Suzy Hansen<\/a>&#8216;s experience.<\/p>\n<p>Later, The Urban Monk.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abduction: Human\u00a0Encounters\u00a0with Aliens, by John E.
