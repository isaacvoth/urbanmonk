These people were protesting the same violence which led to George Floyd being killed. And what was the reason Trump wanted them removed? For one brief photo op in front of the church across the street, St John&#8217;s Church. Police used tear-gas and &#8220;flash-bangs&#8221; plus officers on horse back to very violently clear the area so that Trump could casually walk across the street, hold up a Bible (upside down, it appears!!) and get his photo taken.<\/p>\n<p>The contrast could not be clearer. On one hand, Biden was sensitive to what his presence could mean to the memorial service for George Floyd. On the other hand, Trump caused major disruption, discomfort and injury just for a completely selfish, vain photo-shoot.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier, a few days ago, I heard a news commentator, in another context, characterize Joe Biden&#8217;s actions as, &#8220;. . . what we used to expect our President to be like.&#8221; Trump, on the other hand, exhibits absolutely no sensitivity or concept of what his narcissistic behaviour looks like. He doesn&#8217;t care who gets hurt, or who is pushed around. When he decides he wants something, he cares nothing for anyone in the way.<\/p>\n<p>Our nation cannot afford four more years of this kind of unfeeling, bullying behaviour.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, Joe Biden &#8220;. . . is expected to offer his sympathies to [George] Floyd&#8217;s relatives and record a video message for Floyd&#8217;s funeral service, which is taking place later in the day (June &hellip; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2020\/06\/08\/contrasting-two-presidential-candidates\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1812","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-journal"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1812"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1815,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812\/revisions\/1815"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
