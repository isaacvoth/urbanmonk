It led to the research and publication of more information on these crashes, one in particular, by Scott and Suzanne Ramsey in the 1980&#8217;s and &#8217;90&#8217;s. The incident with the most information occurred in Aztec, New Mexico in 1948. The Ramseys published their research in a couple books. The one I have read is,\u00a0<em>The Aztec UFO Incident<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Another book I want to include in this summary is,\u00a0<em>MO41: The Bombshell Before Roswell<\/em>. This book outlines the scant information on a UFO crash in Missouri in 1941.<\/p>\n<p>If we take a look at all of these incidents, alongside the Roswell incident of 1947, there are numerous similar details. All of them were quickly taken charge of by the military establishment. The military moved in, removed any materiel and bodies, and swore any onlookers to secrecy under threat of death. Only recently, as some of these witnesses neared the end of their natural lives were they motivated to share what they had seen many decades before. They thought that this was information which needed to be more widely known. They understood the profound effects this could have on society, and did not understand why military organizations wanted to keep the information secret. Most of them felt it was very wrong to have been kept from public perception.<\/p>\n<p>None of these books about early UFO crashes are particularly well-written. But the information they outline is so fascinating it is worth a look. It is, after all, where it all began!!<\/p>\n<p>What we hear coming out now is that the information retrieved from these crashes has been reverse-engineered and is now the basis for a rapidly growing secret space program. If you read David Wilcock&#8217;s latest book,\u00a0<em>The Ascension Mysteries<\/em>, you will begin to see the extent of this vast program, involving thousands of people and incorporating technology beyond most of our wildest imaginations.<\/p>\n<p>I do not understand where this is all heading. But writers like Wilcock and others think that some level of disclosure will occur soon. No one can predict what effect this will have on society but there is widespread agreement that just about any level of information regarding this will have quite a profound impact. I, personally, can hardly wait!!!!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This book, by Frank Scully, written in 1950, begins the story of the crash and subsequent recovery of unidentified flying objects in the state of New Mexico.
