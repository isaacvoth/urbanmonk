This video sheds light on the life of Amy Winehouse. She was a singer\/songwriter from London, known most strongly for her jazz and soul singing. Her musical career, from age 18 to when she died at age 27, was phenomenal. She was compared and on stage with other greats, most notably Tony Bennet, Beyonce, and others. Her voice belied her youth. She sounded like a truly soulful 50 or 60 year old, interpreting songs and emotions with great maturity.<\/p>\n<p>Her life, however, was a total mess. She seemed to know this, but was unable to get ahold of stability. Her parents separated when she was 11, the beginning of her pain and trouble. Her mother stated at one point in the video that she was never able to say &#8220;No&#8221; to her daughter. Later in her life, a bodyguard said that all she really needed was for someone to say &#8220;No&#8221; to her.<\/p>\n<p>She managed to pull herself together for periods of time, but inevitably would once again descend into substance abuse to the extreme. She was also severely bulimic, a condition which doctors deem to have contributed to her death. Her body was just too severely compromised to be able to withstand the abuse she put it through, and she finally succumbed.<\/p>\n<p>David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK said this, &#8220;About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her\u2014her career and her life. It&#8217;s a very complicated and tender movie. It tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Such a talented soul, such a bright and loving person, but what a tragic life, overall.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I never planned to write a review of the video,\u00a0Amy, but after watching it last evening and finding myself incredibly moved, I felt I should share a bit of my reactions.
