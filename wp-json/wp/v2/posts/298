This post is the result of a discussion I am engaged in with a young man in my church. He is interested in some of my positions, my beliefs. When I asked him whether his aim was to &#8220;restore&#8221; me to the faith, he replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He insists his own position is only one of seeking the truth; that he wants to listen, hear what I believe, and allow that to inform his own beliefs. We will see!!!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Truth&#8221; which I have been led into, does not fit\u00a0consistently\u00a0with the &#8220;Faith&#8221; of the Church. As I have asked in other contexts, what does a person do when faced with &#8220;Truth&#8221; which does not line up with &#8220;Faith&#8221;? Do I stubbornly stay with &#8220;Faith&#8221;, thus rejecting &#8220;Truth&#8221;? Or do I embrace the &#8220;Truth&#8221; of what I am experiencing, and allow the chips of &#8220;Faith&#8221; to fall where they may? Any of you who have been following my Urban Monk postings know where I come down on that question!<\/p>\n<p>Once again, I appeal to the example of Jesus, who appeared on the scene, not following the orthodoxy of &#8220;Faith&#8221;, proclaiming &#8220;Truth&#8221; at odds with prevailing doctrine. I truly believe that God, the Source of all, is doing a similar thing in our day. The &#8220;Faith&#8221; of Church has become so encrusted with tradition, with centuries-long ways of interpreting &#8220;Truth&#8221;, that it doesn&#8217;t always hold true any more.<\/p>\n<p>Many who have come to positions similar to mine have left the Church. I still feel I am to remain in my church, for whatever reason. I don&#8217;t understand all this very well. But here I am!<\/p>\n<p>The world-wide spiritual awakening taking place today has reportedly reached the vicinity of four to five percent of the population. This is getting close to critical mass. 4-5% can significantly affect the whole. It is exciting to be part of something like this happening in my life-time. I respond with extreme gratitude to Spirit for choosing to reveal &#8220;Truth&#8221; to me. It makes me an oddball in some circles. It causes considerable consternation at times. But it is an exciting journey to be on.<\/p>\n<p>I saw a billboard ad a couple days ago: &#8220;COME HOME; TRUTH CHURCH&#8221;. I can only imagine what they proclaim! They would be so arrogant as to presume to tell me what &#8220;Truth&#8221; is? I think I will stick with God and his Spirit as my source of &#8220;Truth&#8221;!!! I certainly do not know &#8220;Truth&#8221; in entirety. I know only a very little bit. In fact, the more I learn, the more I realize I have yet to learn. But I am being led on a journey of discovery. God, heaven, Spirit, are so much more complex and vast than we can ever, ever imagine in our &#8220;Faith&#8221; formulations!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was tempted to name this post &#8220;Truth versus Faith&#8221;, but that did not quite capture what I am trying to say.
