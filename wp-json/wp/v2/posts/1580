This has been especially true since my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2012\/06\/24\/chapter-thirteen-soul-regression\/\">out-of-body experience<\/a> a few years ago. I can &#8220;meditate&#8221; in bed in the middle of the night, upon awakening, just before going to sleep. Or I can &#8220;meditate&#8221; while walking to the Metro, during a lay-over of a few minutes, while a passenger on public transport, many places.<\/p>\n<p>I place the word, &#8220;meditate&#8221;, in quotes because of course I don&#8217;t always know what others mean by the term. I only know what I myself experience. For me it means getting in touch with something deeper in me than what my senses are telling me. It means listening to the still small voice inside. I liken it to what, in my church days, I called &#8220;prayer&#8221;. I am not always &#8220;talking&#8221; when I &#8220;meditate&#8221;. Maybe it&#8217;s about 50-50; I do &#8220;talk&#8221;. But quite often I am actively listening. It usually takes me some effort to maintain a state of &#8220;meditation&#8221;. I have to work at it.<\/p>\n<p>But I can almost always achieve some level of it. Therefore, when I went several weeks of being unsuccessful at achieving at least some level of &#8220;meditation&#8221; I was quite dismayed. What had happened? What was going on? What was I doing &#8220;wrong&#8221;? Where was the Spirit realm when I needed it? Was the euphoria of my soul regression sessions fading? Was I losing it? Was it permanent? Or would it come back?<\/p>\n<p>Then one morning a couple weeks ago, it came back! I awoke early (a common experience) and just lay quietly in bed, going through some relaxation exercises, seeking for some revelation. Quite suddenly it came. I saw a picture of my life&#8217;s purpose: I am a bridge! A connection. A link, from one thing to another.<\/p>\n<p>I saw this in four ways: 1) from a relatively old-fashioned way of life, to modern civilization; 2) from a working class perspective, to a professional context; 3) from North American culture, to embracing cultures from other continents; 4) from Church, to seeing life from a more spiritual perspective.<\/p>\n<p>I want to deal with each of these in separate blogs. But enough for this introduction.<\/p>\n<p>And, I do want to say, that it was very heartening to be able to regain the eyes of the heart once again. I rode this high for quite a new days!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I usually find it fairly easy to reach a state of &#8220;meditation&#8221;.
