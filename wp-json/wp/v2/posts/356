This book details Kimberly Klein&#8217;s loss of her only child, thirteen-year-old Talia. Ms Klein does a terrific job of sharing the emotions of the first hours and days of hearing that the love of her life has gone. Sharing from notes taken while events unfolded, she shows us what it is like to go through various stages of loss. Incomprehension, un-acceptance, anger, disbelief, panic, frantic action, numbness, depression are not talked about so much as demonstrated. Kimberly Klein allows us into her life at her most vulnerable time. She lets us experience the intense emotions of being in the middle of events she could not control, events she moment-by-moment began to realize were going to culminate in the most tragic way possible.<\/p>\n<p>But the author does not leave us, the reader, there. She takes us through her own journey of discovering her daughter&#8217;s death in a plane crash and the terrible mess of family relationships in a dysfunctional family as they seek to work out legalities.<\/p>\n<p>She also shares with us what it was like to have shared her few years with the truly remarkable, incredible person Talia was. Talia impacted every person she came in contact with during her years on earth. (And she continues to do so!) Klein goes into quite some detail as she shares with us the person Talia was while on earth. She shares with us her own experience of being a single mother devoting her entire existence to properly raising her daughter. She lets us in on her own life, her marriage to Michael, Talia&#8217;s father (who also died in the plane crash), his upbringing, etc. The reader gets a real sense of what her life was like with Talia.<\/p>\n<p>Within hours of Talia&#8217;s death, her mother began to sense Talia&#8217;s presence. One of the first instances was feeling Talia&#8217;s hand on her wrist, sensing Talia instruct her to obtain the bracelet off the wrist of Talia&#8217;s body. This happened quite a long while before the bodies had been recovered from the wreckage of the plane up on a Panamanian mountainside. Thus the book details a completely bittersweet story. It is a story of utter loss; but it is also a story of hope, of wonder, of glory and reassurance.<\/p>\n<p>One of the first messages Talia sent her mother was that she was okay. &#8220;I did not die. I am okay! I am still with you. I will always be with you. You did such a magnificent job of being my mother; you were perfect!&#8221; She then began a long process of communications which\u00a0revealed\u00a0Talia&#8217;s task, sharing with us on earth how we should live. But I get ahead of myself!<\/p>\n<p><em>Hummingbirds Don&#8217;t Fly In The Rain<\/em>\u00a0merely begins to open up the vast body of communication from Talia to us. The conversations continue in two books (thus far) titled <em>The Universe Speaks<\/em>, volumes one and two. <em>Hummingbirds. . . <\/em>ends with the very earliest of these communications, mostly reassuring Kimberly Klein of Talia&#8217;s continuing existence, the gloriousness of this existence, and the sense that she, Talia, has a job to do, now from the Spirit realm. That job is to share truth with those still in body on earth.<\/p>\n<p>She is still Talia over there! Her spunky personality comes through in the communications. She jokes while instilling profound truth! &#8220;But I cannot lie from over here.&#8221; There is definite seriousness in what she is about.<\/p>\n<p>This book is an incredible story. Everyone should read it!! And those who are thus inclined will want to continue to follow Talia&#8217;s communications in\u00a0<em>The Universe Speaks<\/em>. But begin by reading\u00a0<em>Hummingbirds Don&#8217;t Fly In The Rain<\/em>. Even by itself it is an incredibly bittersweet story of loss and hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hummingbirds Don&#8217;t Fly In The Rain, by Kimberly Klein.
