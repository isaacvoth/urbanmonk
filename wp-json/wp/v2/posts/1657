It takes place in the part of the world my wife was raised in, west Texas. As such, it shows a subculture she is very aware of. It is a life she would&#8217;ve been a part of had her daddy not ensured she got out of there.<\/p>\n<p>As such, it is a riveting story of two brothers who hatch a plot to save their family farm. Essentially, without giving too much of the plot away, they start holding up banks to get enough money to avoid defaulting on their mother&#8217;s loans made on the farm before she died. And they specifically target branches of the bank which holds the loans, and who will get title to the land if the family defaults.<\/p>\n<p>It is a very well-done movie, with well-developed characters, and a good pace. It shows well the character of that land, the often desolate landscape, and the types of people inhabiting that part of the country.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommended!!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My wife and I watched this movie not long ago.
