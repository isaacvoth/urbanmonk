Of course, it is the Trump administration. Which is, precisely, Trump.<\/p>\n<p>News commentators have been speculating recently that the spate of firings in the White House signals Trump is feeling more &#8220;comfortable&#8221; in his position as President and is moving toward running everything pretty much on his own, without the advice and consultation of people who actually know what they&#8217;re doing. They say that is pretty much how he ran his businesses and now he is transferring that mode to the Presidency. He is unleashing himself from the advice of those around him, ridding the White House of more and more people who are placed there to guide the President who operates in a very complex position. He does not like to be told &#8220;no&#8221;. So he is increasingly surrounding himself with &#8220;yes&#8221; people, aides who abet and encourage his irrationality.<\/p>\n<p>And, I guess we, the public, should not be surprised. How many times during the campaign did he brag about how capable he was, how good his brain was, and on and on and on?<\/p>\n<p>The fact that things are not turning out much in his favour is causing Trump to act more and more &#8220;crazy&#8221;. There are many reports about how insanely irate he becomes when something he has said or done gets negative reaction. Apparently he begins raving incoherently and threatening all sorts of consequences.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve always seen how completely immature and insecure he is; now we see him becoming desperately unhinged as his administration unravels. Apparently it is in these periods of angry frenzy that he fires off his crazy-sounding tweets.<\/p>\n<p>He reportedly does not read, he is not curious, he doesn&#8217;t ask questions, he can&#8217;t even listen to rational advice longer than a few minutes at a time. He is acting totally without guidance and rational thought.<\/p>\n<p>All of this adds up to a very dangerous situation. I hope and pray that enough congresspeople grow spines soon enough to do something before this crazy man totally destroys the country. And the threat is that if the U.S. goes down, the entire world goes with it. The U.S. has the world&#8217;s largest economy, the world&#8217;s largest military. It is still, despite Trump&#8217;s attempts to increase Russia&#8217;s strength, the most powerful country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>God help us all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been watching U.S. news recently will know right away from my title who\u00a0and what I&#8217;m talking about .
