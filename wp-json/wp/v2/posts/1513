Dolan. A very helpful book. Especially for one like me, who has read here and there about UFO&#8217;s, but never extensively. Dolan&#8217;s book gives a concise overview of UFO&#8217;s over the years. He conjectures about the secrecy surrounding UFO&#8217;s, and offers suggestions about the possibilities of disclosure on the part of the powers-that-be.<\/p>\n<p>It is exciting to consider what could be, what has been, what is now. I have no trouble at all believing that ET aliens are among us, and influencing human development and society. And I equally have no trouble understanding why governments have wanted to keep this secret. Dolan helped put that into perspective for me. While I certainly do not agree with their decisions, I can understand a bit more why they felt the need to keep all this secret.<\/p>\n<p>I appreciate the work which Richard Dolan and others have gone to to keep us informed. Researchers like him go to great lengths to ferret information from the dark corners of secret government programs and then present it to the public in comprehensible ways. Dolan is an interesting lecturer; I heard him last year here in Calgary. It is well worth your time to check him out, whether in person, or through this, his latest book.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UFO&#8217;s for the 21st Century Mind, by Richard M.
