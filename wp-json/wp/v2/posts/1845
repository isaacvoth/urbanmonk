I hope to be able to post occasionally, starting now, at the beginning of 2022. I&#8217;m not sure why it has been so long since I&#8217;ve posted. Did I not have anything worth saying? Did I not think anything I might say was worth anyone else&#8217;s time? I&#8217;m really not sure!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we are in the second year of a pandemic. I am spending a lot of time in the house. I still work part-time; right now I&#8217;m at two days per week. I have several activities on the go. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is, I am considering developing a book discussion topic for the Calgary Jung Society, based on the book, <em>Beyond Jesus<\/em>, by Patricia Pearce. The book is not specifically a Jungian book, but covers themes which fit with Jungian philosophy. The book is basically Pearce&#8217;s spiritual journey. So it deals with spirituality, growing, seeking, etc. This reflects my own odyssey. I have never been satisfied with staying at one state, whether that is spiritual, psychological, emotional, or physical. I always want to push on to something more, some new plane. If you look back at old posts on this web site, you will see that is a characteristic of mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know I&#8217;m not the only one with this condition; thus wanting to open up a discussion for a number of folks to participate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I will let any readers who I may still have on this site know how that turns out. But enough for now. I basically just wanted to get back into the groove of posting!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It has been several years since I have posted on the urbanmonk website.
