Now he has undertaken the task of revealing what he could find out about extraterrestrials among us. His latest book is called,\u00a0<em>Our Occulted History: Do the Global Elite Conceal Ancient Aliens?<\/em> The word &#8220;occulted&#8221; is a bit awkward in my view, but basically means hidden.<\/p>\n<p>His thesis is that the larger population of humans throughout history has been kept in the dark regarding our true origins. He outlines a host of information about ancient sites, such as Gobekli Tepe and the pyramids; he discusses what we know of lost civilizations like Atlantis and Lemuria; he draws in information about the anunnaki and the nefilim; he muses on the possible roles of CIA, the space program, remote viewing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>He concludes his book talking about how the ruling elite, throughout history, have manipulated history. There are a few families, as few as thirteen, who have ruled human civilization for long periods. For example, pretty much all presidents can trace their ancestry to these elite families. These elite feel they are predestined to rule; it is their right, and nothing will keep them from positions of power.<\/p>\n<p>Although Marrs does not go into detail, he pretty much hints broadly that this entitlement is connected to some sort of history with ancient extraterrestrials, the &#8220;sons of god mating with daughters of men&#8221; we read about in the Bible and other ancient writings. These people do not question their right to rule and will do pretty much anything necessary to maintain control. They care nothing for legalities, moral or ethical issues; they care not a whit for the general population, considering us as mere chattel to be ruled and used. We are here for their well-being.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend this book with some reservation. If you have not read anything along these lines, this certainly is a good introduction. Marrs lays things out clearly and plainly. However, for someone who has already done a lot of investigation about such things, it was a bit of a disappointment; it did not go far enough for me.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jim Marrs has made his mark writing about conspiracy theory stuff.\u00a0I have read a book or two of his, I&#8217;m sure, although I did a cursory look through my past Urban Monk postings, but could not find any reviews of &hellip; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2014\/12\/28\/jim-marrs\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1,3],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1489","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-journal","category-book-reviews"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1489","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1489"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1489\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1491,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1489\/revisions\/1491"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1489"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1489"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1489"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
