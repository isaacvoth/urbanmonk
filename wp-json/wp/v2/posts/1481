This book attempts to make connections between this biblical prophecy and what is happening in the USA today.<\/p>\n<p>My disappointment revolves around the fact that I believe there is considerable evidence that 9\/11 was not simply the work of &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, at least not Arab terrorists. And I believe that the turning which the author calls for, the turning back to God, is much deeper than the same old conservative, evangelical perspective we hear so much of from strident preachers. There are levels contained here which the author does not explore.<\/p>\n<p>As I said above, the author, in my opinion, could&#8217;ve done so much more with this material than he did. It&#8217;s like he began tiptoeing into the water, got frightened of the implications (and possible reaction from certain sectors of society), and turned back.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, it was a somewhat entertaining read. Not super well-written, but good enough to help me through to the end.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This book,\u00a0The Harbinger, by Jonathan Cahn, was quite a disappointment.
