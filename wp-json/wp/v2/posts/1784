It was published in 2009. In 2012 I travelled to Boulder, Colorado, to attend a training session in BLSR, Between Lives Soul Regression, put on by Linda Backman&#8217;s organization, the Ravenheart Center. Earlier I had taken an online course in PLSR, Past Lives Soul Regression with Linda Backman. All of this as a way of introduction to this remarkable woman!<\/p>\n<p>In this review I will deal with her first two books, the one mentioned above, and her second,\u00a0<em>The Evolving Soul: Spiritual Healing Through Past Life Exploration<\/em>. I am just beginning her third book, published in 2018, and will review that at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>First, a bit about the author. Linda is a licensed psychologist, having practiced since 1978. In the early 1990&#8217;s, through a personal experience of encountering the soul of a partner who had just died. She began researching information on what she was experiencing, and was led to training under Michael Newton, who is a pioneer regression therapist. Newton&#8217;s two books,\u00a0<em>Journey of Souls<\/em>, and\u00a0<em>Destiny of Souls<\/em> are highly, highly recommended reading for anyone even remotely interested in this topic.<\/p>\n<p>Linda Backman began her own regression hypnotherapy practice and has guided innumerable people in recovering memories they have of previous lives and the time in-between incarnations. Drawing from the knowledge of her many sessions with clients she explains some of the lessons we can learn from soul regression. These lessons are detailed in her first book, with many transcriptions of sessions she has guided.<\/p>\n<p>These sessions are most often profound, life-changing events in a person&#8217;s life, as I myself have experienced, and detail in other posts on the Urban Monk site. Because many of the aspects of soul regression are detailed elsewhere, I will not go into great detail in reviewing Dr Backman&#8217;s first book.<\/p>\n<p>Her second book, however, delves into more detail in areas I am currently more interested in, so I will say more about that here.
