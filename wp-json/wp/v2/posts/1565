Her first was about her relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald, called,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2015\/01\/30\/judyth-vary-baker\/\">Me and Lee.<\/a>\u00a0<\/em>This book, titled,\u00a0<em>David Ferrie<\/em>, is about a very enigmatic character who was part of the circle of people Judyth came in contact with in New Orleans during the summer of 1963. This is the first book to really focus specifically on this mysterious man.<\/p>\n<p>David Ferrie was truly an enigma. A fantastically gifted person, but also quite a scumbag! A homosexual in a time when this was a crime, continually on the edge of the law. He would work for the CIA, for the mafia, wherever he could get paid.<\/p>\n<p>He got involved in the plot to develop a lethal mixture of cancer cells which the CIA hoped to inject into Fidel Castro. The cancer research was what had brought the author to New Orleans in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>The Castro plan unravelled at the last minute. Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in this plot for the main reason that he thought this would save President Kennedy&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>The book,\u00a0<em>David Ferrie<\/em>, is a fascinating look into the inner workings of one part of the assassination scenario of 1963. It is also an intriguing look into the life of this somewhat pathetic man.<\/p>\n<p>In Ferrie&#8217;s last phone conversation with Judyth Vary Baker, shortly after the assassination, he told her she had to keep her head down, stay under the radar, in order to remain alive. Judyth succeeded in doing this, still alive to this day. Just about all the other players in the assassination drama have been killed, most within a short time. David Ferrie himself died suspiciously (like all the others) within five years. Judyth&#8217;s name and her involvement with Oswald was, when even acknowledged, totally disparaged as a rather unreliable and flakey witness. Nobody took her story seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Judyth lives in exile, for her own safety. She appears occasionally for interviews. These two books, published in the last five years, have brought her name to greater public awareness. In her seventies now, she wants the truth known. She promised David Ferrie in that last phone call, that she had to remain alive in order to tell Oswald&#8217;s two children the truth about their father.<\/p>\n<p>This book, as a follow-up to\u00a0<em>Me and Lee<\/em>, is yet another fascinating look at the New Orleans group who ultimately became involved in the assassination plot. Certainly worth a read. But read\u00a0<em>Me and Lee<\/em> first, to give a fuller context to\u00a0<em>David Ferrie<\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Judyth Vary Baker has written a second book about the JFK assassination and the people involved in it.
