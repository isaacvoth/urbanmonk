But no ideas would come to me; nothing seemed compelling enough to share. Then, a few days ago I watched the video of <em>Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away<\/em>. During this magnificent performance numerous Beatles&#8217; songs were used, including <em>Blackbird:<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night<\/p>\n<p>Take these broken wings and learn to fly<\/p>\n<p>All your life<\/p>\n<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night<\/p>\n<p>Take these sunken eyes and learn to see<\/p>\n<p>All your life<\/p>\n<p>You were only waiting for this moment to be free.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<\/p>\n<p>Into the light of the dark black night.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There it was! An idea! As I shared in <a title=\"Euphoric!\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanmonk.com\/2013\/06\/10\/euphoric\/\">June<\/a>, there is a growing sense of impending events signalling a significant shift in human consciousness, if not in larger society. I am reading and hearing this from many sources, and it resonates with my spirit.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You were only waiting for this moment to arise!&#8221; It is as if I, and the human race, have been waiting for oh-so-long for this moment to arise, for this moment to be free! \u00a0&#8220;Fly, into the light. . .&#8221; How we collectively have been waiting for this!<\/p>\n<p>No clear, unified picture emerges of exactly what we are awaiting. There are, however, many ideas of what this might entail. One broad category which comes up in spiritual revelations is that of &#8220;disclosure&#8221;. But, disclosure of what, exactly?<\/p>\n<p>Church theology from my past tells me, &#8220;We are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. . .&#8221; (Hebrews 12.1) &#8220;Lo, I am with you always . . .&#8221; (Matthew 28.20) There does appear to be evidence (and it is growing!) that we are being helped and guided by heavenly beings.\u00a0In the context of some sort of coming &#8220;disclosure&#8221;, at some point, these heavenly beings will make themselves known to us; they will allow us to know their presence, to discern more clearly that they have been with us all the way and at all times, that they have been assisting us, as humanity, to grow and to increase our spiritual knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>But one message about this disclosure, repeated in various ways, is that these beings will not disclose themselves until we as a race have made some significant shifts in the way we run our affairs. One major &#8220;problem&#8221; at present is the financial imbalance in society today. The message being received is that heaven will not reveal itself prior to some significant changes in financial structures because it would cause too much panic in society to disclose earlier. Apparently once some major shifts have occurred there will be a greater openness to these beings revealing themselves. At least that is the message I am sensing most clearly. We will see if this pans out.<\/p>\n<p>To me, completely uninvolved in the world&#8217;s financial structures, this appears to be a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>huge<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0obstacle. Power structures are so firmly entrenched that it feels like they will never change, especially change toward the positive, toward a more equitable distribution of resources. And yet, the messages being received from heaven suggest that this sort of change will occur fairly soon (in weeks or months, not years), and that it will be a huge shift.<\/p>\n<p>One encouraging indication I personally have been aware of is that I have read of various people and groups working to undo some of the power structures for the past number of years and decades. Some intense spiritual warfare is going on.<\/p>\n<p>Again, since I come out of a very biblical background, I make reference to scripture. The \u00a0&#8220;. . . wiles of the devil&#8221; are listed as being not &#8220;. . . flesh and blood. . . [but] . . . principalities, . . . powers, . . . world rulers of this present darkness, . . . spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&#8221; (Ephesians 6.11,12)\u00a0These forces of power have been in place for a long, long time&#8211;centuries, millennia even. And people are being called upon and equipped to participate in unravelling the intricate webs of power which have held the human race captive for so long.<\/p>\n<p>Another encouraging sign I see in this context is NESARA, the\u00a0National Economic Security and Recovery Act. Apparently this was a USA idea brought before Congress in the 1990&#8217;s. The ideas, I gather, are still around, and it sounds like there may be a move to resurrect the ideas of NESARA and hopefully implement them to some extent. NESARA concepts would lead to the aforementioned more-equitable society, less of a rich\/poor divide, etc.<\/p>\n<p>So, ideas are floating around, being talked about, and strategized. Hopefully something comes of all this.<\/p>\n<p>Another truth I keep mulling over is the statement by Jesus, &#8220;The kingdom of God is within you.&#8221; (Luke 17.21) We have, within us already, the strength and wisdom to know what needs to be done. We are not to go looking outside ourselves for the answers or instruction we need. We have been equipped already. Just do it! We must look inside ourselves to hear God and what he wants us as individuals and societies to do in order to bring about his kingdom upon earth.<\/p>\n<p>We might feel we are limping along with broken wings and sunken eyes, but we are asked to take our frail resources, and learn to fly, into the light of the dark black night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a week I had been thinking that it was past time to post another blog.
