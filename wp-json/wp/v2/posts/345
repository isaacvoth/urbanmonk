A week or two back my granddaughter, age 15 months, was at our house, accompanied by her entourage (parents and grandmother). At one point in the evening she was on the couch with her two grandmothers. She was flinging herself every which way, rolling and twisting as she played with her growing strengths and abilities. Without the careful attention of the grandmothers she would surely have ended up on the floor numerous times, or even crashed into the coffee table nearby. Completely unaware of the possible danger she trusted implicitly the watchful care of her grandmothers. She was free to try out her\u00a0increasing\u00a0sense of self, her constantly developing coordination and strength. She threw herself unselfconsciously in various directions, completely trusting others to catch her and keep her from self-destruction!<\/p>\n<p>Could this be what the ascended master Yeshua meant 2000 years ago when he said to his followers that they needed to become like little children to enter the kingdom of heaven?<\/p>\n<p>Through my life in the church I have heard many sermons on this saying and have pondered it much. I\u00a0know this idea has been debated back-and-forth for centuries. Certainly there are aspects of childhood he did not intend, such as the complete self-centered-ness and immaturity of young children. But methinks that the complete trust shown by my granddaughter on the couch must be at least part of what the teacher meant when he said those words.<\/p>\n<p>Can I trust that much? Can I fling myself backwards, trusting heaven to catch me lest I fall? Can I twist and turn as I experiment with new-found freedoms, knowing I will not be allowed to go so far as to injure myself? Do I envision the universe as my playground, mine to explore, seeking ever new vistas and dimensions hitherto undreamt of?<\/p>\n<p>And how does God watch over me, ensuring my safety? In my past this mechanism was largely realized by Church and its book. With council from fellow explorers and with diligent study of the book, we boldly went where no one had gone before (at least in our experience!!).<\/p>\n<p>Church, and its book, no longer are sufficient safeguards for me. I find them to be stultifying and restricting, preventing me from fully\u00a0experiencing\u00a0my growing freedom. And I find this sentiment shared increasingly by those I encounter. More and more people are finding organized religion to be restrictive to spiritual growth. In this age of spiritual awakening the old safety nets don&#8217;t work. For many centuries they worked just fine. But no longer. There are new things happening. God is doing a new work in our day. The old categories and strictures are falling by the wayside for growing numbers.<\/p>\n<p>How bold can we be as we\u00a0obediently\u00a0trust that we are cared for and watched over?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I awoke this morning thinking of trust.
