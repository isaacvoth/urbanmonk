					<description><![CDATA[Well done Urban Monk!  Fabulous blog post and I am so pleased that you have the website up and running!  It looks great!

Well written and thoughtful post!  I would suggest that you may want to read &quot;The Alphabet versus the Goddess&quot; by Leonard Shlain -- in it he explains the origins of the Church&#039;s fascination with &#039;the word&#039; versus image or experience.  VERY interesting indeed!

Have a beautiful day!

					<description><![CDATA[UM, I read your most recent journal entry.  Following your heart is a huge shift for you.  I&#039;m pleased for you (and for me).  The piece is very well written.  It&#039;s clear.  It&#039;s personable.  

I&#039;m going back to your website now, to look at more stuff.
